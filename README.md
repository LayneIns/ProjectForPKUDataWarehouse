##A Brief Explanation to the File Structure

###authorï¼šWillsNew

This is a brief explanation to the file structure.

There are four directories in the *.zip* file submitted.
 
		1.  /code
			The directory "code" includes the code files I use in the project. 
			There are two main algorithm files in the "code" directory ---- "Apriori.py" and "fp_growth.py".
			And the other files are all used for the data retrieving process.
			There are some notes for the two algorithms and there is no note for the codes used to process the data.
 		
		2. /codeResult
			This directory contains the results produced by the code.
			If you don't want to run the code yourself or want to use some different results as a comparison, you can just refer to the results here. 
		
		3. /data
			The data directory contains the data I use. 
			There are three directories in "data" directory
			-- /ChineseNovelData: The Chinese novel data
			-- /EnglishNovelData: The English novel data
			-- /EnglishPaperData: The English paper data
			And there are also two stopword files, respectively for English and Chinese.
			Meanwhile, the .pkl files are Python dictionaries generated when I processing the data. They interpret the string to number or interpret the number to string.

		4. /NumberData
			There are the datas I directly use for my code. You can just use them as the algorithms' input.

And the detailed usage for the code is shown in my report. If any question exists, just email me at  *willsliu1996@gmail.com*
