dedication. 
to the city of bombay. 
the city be full of pride challenge each to each this from her mountain side that from her burthen beach. 
they count their ship full tale their corn and oil and wine derrick and loom and bale and rampart s gun fleck line. city by city they hail. hast aught to match with mine. 
and the men that breed from them they traffic up and down but cling to their city hem a a child to the mother s gown. 
when they talk with the strange band daze and newly alone. when they walk in the strange land by roar street unknown. bless her where she stand for strength above their own. 
on high to hold her fame that stand all fame beyond by oath to back the same most faithful foolish fond. make her mere breathe name their bond upon their bond. 
so thank i god my birth fell not in isle aside waste headland of the earth or war tribe untried but that she lend me worth and give me right to pride. 
surely in toil or fray under an alien sky comfort it be to say. of no mean city be i. 
neither by service nor fee come i to mine estate mother of city to me for i be bear in her gate between the palm and the sea where the world end steamer wait. 
now for this debt i owe and for her far bear cheer must i make haste and go with tribute to her pier. 
and she shall touch and remit after the use of king. orderly ancient fit. my deep sea plundering and purchase in all land. and this we do for a sign her power be over mine and mine i hold at her hand. 
a song of the english. 
fair be our lot o goodly be our heritage. humble ye my people and be fearful in your mirth. for the lord our god most high he hath make the deep a dry he hath smite for u a pathway to the end of all the earth. 
yea though we sin and our ruler go from righteousness deep in all dishonour though we stain our garment hem. oh be ye not dismay though we stumble and we stray we be lead by evil counsellor the lord shall deal with them. 
hold ye the faith the faith our father seal√®d u. whore not with vision overwise and overstale. except ye pay the lord single heart and single sword of your child in their bondage shall he ask them treble tale. 
keep ye the law be swift in all obedience. clear the land of evil drive the road and bridge the ford. make ye sure to each his own that he reap what he hath sow. by the peace among our people let men know we serve the lord. 
* * * * *. 
hear now a song a song of break interlude a song of little cunning. of a singer nothing worth. through the naked word and mean may ye see the truth between a the singer know and touch it in the end of all the earth. 
the coastwise light. 
our brow be wreathe with spindrift and the weed be on our knee. our loin be batter neath u by the swing smoke sea. from reef and rock and skerry over headland ness and voe the coastwise light of england watch the ship of england go. 
through the endless summer evening on the lineless level floor. through the yell channel tempest when the syren hoot and roar by day the dip house flag and by night the rocket s trail a the sheep that graze behind u so we know them where they hail. 
we bridge across the dark and bid the helmsman have a care the flash that wheel inland wake his sleep wife to prayer. from our vex eyry head to gale we bind in burn chain the lover from the sea rim draw his love in english lane. 
we greet the clipper wing and wing that race the southern wool. we warn the crawl cargo tank of bremen leith and hull. to each and all our equal lamp at peril of the sea the white wall side warship or the whaler of dundee. 
come up come in from eastward from the guard port of the morn. beat up beat in from southerly o gipsy of the horn. swift shuttle of an empire s loom that weave u main to main the coastwise light of england give you welcome back again. 
go get you go up channel with the sea crust on your plate. go get you into london with the burden of your freight. haste for they talk of empire there and say if any seek the light of england send you and by silence shall ye speak. 
the song of the dead. 
hear now the song of the dead in the north by the tear berg edge they that look still to the pole asleep by their hide strip sledge. song of the dead in the south in the sun by their skeleton horse where the warrigal whimper and bay through the dust of the sere river course. 
song of the dead in the east in the heat rot jungle hollow where the dog ape bark in the kloof in the brake of the buffalo wallow. song of the dead in the west in the barren the snow that betray them where the wolverine tumble their pack from the camp and the grave mound they make them. hear now the song of the dead. 
i. 
we be dreamer dream greatly in the man stifle town. we yearn beyond the skyline where the strange road go down. come the whisper come the vision come the power with the need. till the soul that be not man s soul be lend u to lead. a the deer break a the steer break from the herd where they graze in the faith of little child we go on our way. then the wood fail then the food fail then the last water dry in the faith of little child we lay down and die. on the sand drift on the veldt side in the fern scrub we lay that our son might follow after by the bone on the way. follow after follow after. we have water the root and the bud ha come to blossom that ripen for fruit. follow after we be wait by the trail that we lose for the sound of many footstep for the tread of a host. follow after follow after for the harvest be sow. by the bone about the wayside ye shall come to your own.

when drake go down to the horn and england be crown thereby twixt sea unsailed and shore unhailed our lodge our lodge be bear. and england be crown thereby. 
which never shall close again by day nor yet by night while man shall take his life to stake at risk of shoal or main. by day nor yet by night. 
but standeth even so a now we witness here while men depart of joyful heart adventure for to know. a now bear witness here. 
ii. 
we have feed our sea for a thousand year and she call u still unfed though there s never a wave of all her wave but mark our english dead. we have straw our best to the weed s unrest to the shark and the sheer gull. if blood be the price of admiralty lord god we ha pay in full. 
there s never a flood go shoreward now but lift a keel we man. there s never an ebb go seaward now but drop our dead on the sand but slink our dead on the sand forlore from the ducies to the swin. if blood be the price of admiralty if blood be the price of admiralty lord god we ha pay it in. 
we must fee our sea for a thousand year for that be our doom and pride a it be when they sail with the golden hind or the wreck that strike last tide or the wreck that lie on the spout reef where the ghastly blue light flare. if blood be the price of admiralty if blood be the price of admiralty if blood be the price of admiralty lord god we ha buy it fair. 
the deep sea cable. 
the wreck dissolve above u. their dust drop down from afar down to the dark to the utter dark where the blind white sea snake be. there be no sound no echo of sound in the desert of the deep or the great gray level plain of ooze where the shell bur cable creep. 
here in the womb of the world here on the tie rib of earth word and the word of men flicker and flutter and beat warn sorrow and gain salutation and mirth for a power trouble the still that ha neither voice nor foot. 
they have waken the timeless thing. they have kill their father time. join hand in the gloom a league from the last of the sun. hush. men talk to day o er the waste of the ultimate slime and a new word run between. whisper let u be one. 
the song of the son. 
one from the end of the earth gift at an open door treason ha much but we mother thy son have more. from the whine of a die man from the snarl of a wolf pack free turn for the world be thine. mother be proud of thy seed. count be we feeble or few. hear be our speech so rude. look be we poor in the land. judge be we men of the blood. 
those that have stay at thy knee mother go call them in we that be breed overseas wait and would speak with our kin. not in the dark do we fight haggle and flout and gibe. sell our love for a price loan our heart for a bribe. gift have we only to day love without promise or fee hear for thy child speak from the uttermost part of the sea.

the first chantey. 
mine be the woman to me darkling i find her. hale her dumb from the camp hold her and bind her. hot rise her tribe on our track ere i have prove her. hear her laugh in the gloom greatly i love her. 
swift through the forest we run. none stand to guard u few be my people and far. then the flood bar u him we call son of the sea sullen and swell. pant we wait the death stealer and steal. 
yet ere they come to my lance lay for the slaughter lightly she leap to a log lap in the water. hold on high and apart skin that array her call she the god of the wind that he should aid her. 
life have the tree at that word. praise we the giver. otter like leave he the bank for the full river. far fell their ax behind flash and ring wonder be on me and fear yet she be sing. 
low lay the land we have leave. now the blue bind u even the floor of the god level around u. whisper there be not nor word shadow nor show still the light stir on the deep glow and grow. 
then do he leap to his place flare from under he the compeller the sun bar to our wonder. nay not a league from our eye blind with gaze clear he the womb of the world huge and amaze. 
this we behold. and we live. the pit of the burn then the god speak to the tree for our return. back to the beach of our flight fearless and slowly back to our slayer he go. but we be holy. 
men that be hot in that hunt woman that follow babe that be promise our bone tremble and wallow. over the neck of the tribe crouch and fawn prophet and priestess we come back from the dawn. 
the last chantey. 
and there be no more sea. 
thus say the lord in the vault above the cherub call to the angel and the soul in their degree. lo. earth ha pass away on the smoke of judgment day. that our word may be establish shall we gather up the sea. 
loud sing the soul of the jolly jolly mariner. plague upon the hurricane that make u furl and flee. but the war be do between u in the deep the lord hath see u our bone we ll leave the barracout and god may sink the sea. 
then say the soul of juda that betray√®d him. lord hast thou forget thy covenant with me. how once a year i go to cool me on the floe and ye take my day of mercy if ye take away the sea. 
then say the soul of the angel of the off shore wind. he that bit the thunder when the bull mouth breaker flee. i have watch and ward to keep o er thy wonder on the deep and ye take mine honour from me if ye take away the sea. 
loud sing the soul of the jolly jolly mariner. nay but we be angry and a hasty folk be we. if we work the ship together till she founder in foul weather be we babe that we should clamour for a vengeance on the sea. 
then say the soul of the slave that men throw overboard. kennel in the picaroon a weary band be we. but thy arm be strong to save and it touch u on the wave and we drowse the long tide idle till thy trumpet tear the sea. 
then cry the soul of the stout apostle paul to god. once we frap a ship and she labour woundily. there be fourteen score of these and they bless thee on their knee when they learn thy grace and glory under malta by the sea. 
loud sing the soul of the jolly jolly mariner pluck at their harp and they pluck unhandily. our thumb be rough and tar and the tune be something hard may we lift a deep sea chantey such a seaman use at sea. 
then say the soul of the gentleman adventurer fetter wrist to bar all for red iniquity. ho we revel in our chain o er the sorrow that be spain s. heave or sink it leave or drink it we be master of the sea. 
up spake the soul of a gray gothavn speckshioner. he that lead the flinch in the fleet of fair dundee. ho the ringer and right whale and the fish we strike for sale will ye whelm them all for wantonness that wallow in the sea. 
loud sing the soul of the jolly jolly mariner cry. under heaven here be neither lead nor lea. must we sing for evermore on the windless glassy floor. take back your golden fiddle and we ll beat to open sea. 
then stoop the lord and he call the good sea up to him and stablished his border unto all eternity that such a have no pleasure for to praise the lord by measure they may enter into galleon and serve him on the sea. 
sun wind and cloud shall fail not from the face of it sting ring spindrift nor the fulmar fly free. and the ship shall go abroad to the glory of the lord who hear the silly sailor folk and give them back their sea. 
the merchantman. 
king solomon draw merchantman because of his desire for peacock ape and ivory from tarshish unto tyre. with cedar out of lebanon which hiram raft down but we be only sailormen that use in london town. 
coastwise cross sea round the world and back again where the flaw shall head u or the full trade suit plain sail storm sail lay your board and tack again and that s the way we ll pay paddy doyle for his boot. 
we bring no store of ingot of spice or precious stone but that we have we gather with sweat and ache bone. in flame beneath the tropic in frost upon the floe and jeopardy of every wind that doe between them go. 
and some we get by purchase and some we have by trade and some we find by courtesy of pike and carronade at midnight mid sea meeting for charity to keep and light the roll homeward bind that ride a foot too deep. 
by sport of bitter weather we re walty strain and scar from the kentledge on the kelson to the sling upon the yard. six ocean have their will of u to carry all away our galley s in the baltic and our boom s in mossel bay. 
we ve flounder off the texel awash with sodden deal we ve slip from valparaiso with the norther at our heel. we ve ratched beyond the crossets that tusk the southern pole and dip our gunnel under to the dread agulhas roll. 
beyond all out chart we sail where none have sail and saw the land light burn on island none have hail. our hair stand up for wonder but when the night be do there dance the deep to windward blue empty neath the sun. 
strange consort ride beside u and bring u evil luck. the witch fire climb our channel and dance on vane and truck. till through the red tornado that lash u nigh to blind we saw the dutchman plunge full canvas head to wind. 
we ve hear the midnight leadsman that call the black deep down ay thrice we ve hear the swimmer the thing that may not drown. on freeze bunt and gasket the sleet cloud drave her host when man by more than sign with u we pass the isle o ghost. 
and north amid the hummock a biscuit toss below we meet the silent shallop that fright whaler know. for down a cruel ice lane that open a he speed we saw dead henry hudson steer north by west his dead. 
so deal god s water with u beneath the roar sky so walk his sign and marvel all naked to our eye. but we be head homeward with trade to lose or make good lord they slip behind u in the tail of our wake. 
let go let go the anchor. now sham at heart be we to bring so poor a cargo home that have for gift the sea. let go the great bow anchor ah fool be we and blind the bad we bale with utter toil the best we leave behind. 
coastwise cross sea round the world and back again whither the flaw shall fail u or the trade drive down. plain sail storm sail lay your board and tack again and all to bring a cargo up to london town.

behind my message hard i come and nigh have find a grave for me. but that i launch of steel and flame do war against the wave for me. 
uprise the deep by gale on gale to bid me change my mind again he break his teeth along my rail and roar swing behind again. 
i stay the sun at noon to tell my way across the waste of it. i read the storm before it fell and make the good haste of it. 
afar i hail the land at night the tower i build have hear of me and ere my rocket reach it height have flash my love the word of me. 
earth give her choose men of strength. they live and strive and die for me. to drive my road a nation s length and toss the mile aside for me. 
i snatch their toil to serve my need too slow their fleet fly for me i tire twenty smoke steed and bid them bait a new for me. 
i send the lightning forth to see where hour by hour she wait me. among ten million one be she and surely all men hat me.

the rhyme of the three sealer. 
away by the land of the japanee when the paper lantern glow and the crew of all the ship drink in the house of blood street joe at twilight when the landward breeze bring up the harbour noise and ebb of yokohama bay swig chatter through the buoy in cisco s dewdrop din room they tell the tale anew of a hide sea and a hide fight when the baltic run from the northern light and the stralsund fight the two. 
now this be the law of the muscovite that he prof with shoot and steel when ye come by his isle in the smoky sea ye must not take the seal where the gray sea go nakedly between the weed hang shelf and the little blue fox he be breed for his skin and the seal they breed for themselves. for when the matkas seek the shore to drop their pup aland the great man seal haul out of the sea aroaring band by band. and when the first september gale have slake their rut wrath the great man seal haul back to the sea and no man know their path. then dark they lie and stark they lie rookery dune and floe and the northern light come down o night to dance with the houseless snow. and god who clear the ground berg and steer the grind floe he hear the cry of the little kit fox and the lemming on the snow. but since our woman must walk gay and money buy their gear the seal boat they filch that way at hazard year by year. english they be and japanee that hang on the brown bear s flank and some be scot but the bad god wot and the bold thief be yank. 
it be the sealer northern light to the smoky sea she bore. with a stovepipe stick from a starboard port and the russian flag at her fore. baltic stralsund and northern light oh. they be bird of a feather slip away to the smoky sea three seal thief together. and at last she come to a sandy cove and the baltic lay therein but her men be up with the herd seal to drive and club and skin. there be fifteen hundred skin abeach cool pelt and proper fur when the northern light drive into the bight and the sea mist drive with her. the baltic call her men and weigh she could not choose but run for a stovepipe see through the close mist it show like a four inch gun. and loss it be that be sad a death to lose both trip and ship and lie for a rot contraband on vladivostock slip. she turn and dive in the sea smother a a rabbit dive in the whin and the northern light send up her boat to steal the steal skin. they have not bring a load to side or slide their hatch clear when they be aware of a sloop of war ghost white and very near. her flag she show and her gun she show three of them black abeam and a funnel white with the crust salt but never a show of steam. there be no time to man the brake they knock the shackle free and the northern light stand out again goose wing to open sea. 
for life it be that be bad than death by force of russian law to work in the mine of mercury that loose the teeth in your jaw. they have not run a mile from shore they hear no shot behind when the skipper smite his hand on his thigh and throw her up in the wind. bluff raise out on a bluff say he for if my name s tom hall you must set a thief to catch a thief and a thief ha catch u all. by every butt in oregon and every spar in maine the hand that spill the wind from her sail be the hand of reuben paine. he ha rig and trigged her with paint and spar and faith he ha fake her well but i d know the stralsund s deckhouse yet from here to the boom o hell. oh once we ha meet at baltimore and twice on boston pier but the sick day for you reuben paine be the day that you come here the day that you come here my lad to scare u from our seal with your funnel make o your paint cloth and your gun o rotten deal. ring and blow for the baltic now and head her back to the bay for we ll come into the game again with a double deck to play. 
they ring and blow the sealer call the poach cry o the sea and they raise the baltic out of the mist and an angry ship be she. and blind they grope through the whirl white and blind to the bay again till they hear the creak of the stralsund s boom and the clank of her moor chain. they lay them down by bitt and boat their pistol in their belt and. will you fight for it reuben paine or will you share the pelt. 
a dog toothed laugh laugh reuben paine and bar his flenching knife. yea skin for skin and all that he hath a man will give for his life. but i ve six thousand skin below and yeddo port to see and there s never a law of god or man run north of fifty three. so go in peace to the naked sea with empty hold to fill and i ll be good to your seal this catch a many a i shall kill. 
answer the snap of a close lock and the jar of a gun butt slide but the tender fog shut fold on fold to hide the wrong they do. the weep fog roll fold on fold the wrath of man to cloak and the flame spurt pale run down the rail a the seal rifle speak. the bullet bite on bend and butt the splinter sliver free. little they trust to sparrow dust that stop the seal in his sea. the thick smoke hang and would not shift leaden it lay and blue but three be down on the baltic s deck and two of the stralsund s crew. an arm s length out and overside the bank fog hold them bind. but a they hear or groan or word they fire at the sound. for one cry out on the name of god and one to have him cease. and the quest volley find them both and bid them hold their peace. and one call out on a heathen joss and one on the virgin s name. and the school bullet leap across and show them whence they come. and in the wait silence the rudder whine beneath and each man draw his watchful breath slow take tween the teeth trigger and ear and eye acock knit brow and hard draw lip brace his foot by chock and cleat for the roll of the ship. till they hear the cough of a wound man that fight in the fog for breath till they hear the torment of reuben paine that wail upon his death. 
the tide they ll go through fundy race but i ll go never more and see the hog from ebb tide mark turn scamper back to shore. no more i ll see the trawler drift below the bass rock grind or watch the tall fall steamer light tear blaze up the sound. sorrow be me in a lonely sea and a sinful fight i fall but if there s law o god or man you ll swing for it yet tom hall. 
tom hall stand up by the quarter rail. your word in your teeth say he. there s never a law of god or man run north of fifty three. so go in grace with him to face and an ill spend life behind and i ll take care o your widow rube a many a i shall find. a stralsund man shoot blind and large and a warlock finn be he and he hit tom hall with a burst ball a hand s breadth over the knee. tom hall catch hold by the top lift and sit him down with an oath you ll wait a little rube he say the devil ha call for both. the devil be drive both this tide and the kill ground be close and we ll go up to the wrath of god a the holluschickie go. o men put back your gun again and lay your rifle by we ve fight our fight and the best be down. let up and let u die. quit fire by the bow there quit. call off the baltic s crew. you re sure of hell a me or rube but wait till we get through. 
there go no word between the ship but thick and quick and loud the life blood drum on the drip deck with the fog dew from the shroud the sea pull draw them side by side gunnel to gunnel lay and they felt the sheerstrakes pound and clear but never a word be say. 
then reuben paine cry out again before his spirit pass. have i follow the sea for thirty year to die in the dark at last. curse on her work that ha nip me here with a shifty trick unkind i have get my death where i get my bread but i dare not face it blind. curse on the fog. be there never a wind of all the wind i know to clear the smother from off my chest and let me look at the blue. the good fog hear like a splitten sail to leave and right she tear and they saw the sun dog in the haze and the seal upon the shore. silver and gray run spit and bay to meet the steel back tide and pinch and white in the clear light the crew star overside. o rainbow gay the red pool lay that swill and spill and spread and gold raw gold the spend shell roll between the careless dead the dead that rock so drunkenwise to weather and to lee and they saw the work their hand have do a god have bid them see. 
and a little breeze blow over the rail that make the headsail lift but no man stand by wheel or sheet and they let the schooner drift. and the rattle rise in reuben s throat and he cast his soul with a cry and go already. tom hall he say. then it s time for me to die. his eye be heavy with great sleep and yearn for the land and he speak a a man that talk in dream his wind beneath his hand. oh there come no good in the westering wind that back against the sun. wash down the deck they re all too red and share the skin and run baltic stralsund and northern light clean share and share for all you ll find the fleet off tolstoi mees but you will not find tom hall. evil he do in shoal water and black sin on the deep but now he s sick of watch and trick and now he ll turn and sleep. he ll have no more of the crawl sea that make him suffer so but he ll lie down on the kill ground where the holluschickie go. and west you ll turn and south again beyond the sea fog s rim and tell the yoshiwara girl to burn a stick for him. and you ll not weight him by the heel and dump him overside but carry him up to the sand hollow to die a bering die and make a place for reuben paine that know the fight be fair and leave the two that do the wrong to talk it over there. 
half steam ahead by guess and lead for the sun be mostly veil through fog to fog by luck and log sail ye a bering sail. and if the light shall lift aright to give your landfall plain north and by west from zapne crest ye raise the cross twain. fair mark be they to the inner bay the reckless poacher know what time the scar see catchie lead their sleek seraglio. ever they hear the floe pack clear and the blast of the old bull whale and the deep seal roar that beat off shore above the loud gale. ever they wait the winter s hate a the thunder boorga call where northward look they to st. george and westward to st. paul s. ever they greet the hunt fleet lone keel off headland drear when the seal schooner flit that way at hazard year by year. ever in yokohama port men tell the tale anew of a hide sea and a hide fight when the baltic run from the northern light and the stralsund fight the two.

with my _tinka tinka tinka tinka tink. [and the axe ha clear the mountain croup and crest. ] so we ride the iron stallion down to drink through the ca√±ons to the water of the west. 
and the tune that mean so much to you alone common tune that make you choke and blow your nose vulgar tune that bring the laugh that bring the groan i can rip your very heartstrings out with those. with the feast and the folly and the fun and the lie and the lust and the drink and the merry play that drop you when you re do to the thought that burn like iron if you think. 
with my _plunka lunka lunka lunka lunk. here s a trifle on account of pleasure past ere the wit that make you win give you eye to see your sin and the heavy repentance at the last.

to our private taste there be always something a little exotic almost artificial in song which under an english aspect and dress be yet so manifestly the product of other sky. they affect u like translation. the very fauna and flora be alien remote. the dog s tooth violet be but an ill substitute for the rathe primrose nor can we ever believe that the wood robin sing a sweetly in april a the english thrush. the athen√¶um.

the last rhyme of true thomas. 
the king ha call for priest and cup the king ha take spur and blade to dub true thomas a belt knight and all for the sake o the song he make. 
they have seek him high they have seek him low they have seek him over down and lea. they have find him by the milk white thorn that guard the gate o faerie. 
twas bend beneath and blue above their eye be hold that they might not see the kine that graze between the know oh they be the queen o faerie. 
now cease your song the king he say oh cease your song and get you dight to vow your vow and watch your arm for i will dub you a belt knight. 
for i will give you a horse o pride wi blazon and spur and page and squire. wi keep and tail and seizin and law and land to hold at your desire. 
true thomas smile above his harp and turn his face to the naked sky where blow before the wastrel wind the thistle down she float by. 
i ha vow my vow in another place and bitter oath it be on me i ha watch my arm the lee long night where five score fight men would flee. 
my lance be tip o the hammer flame my shield be beat o the moonlight cold. and i win my spur in the middle world a thousand fathom beneath the mould. 
and what should i make wi a horse o pride and what should i make wi a sword so brown but spill the ring o the gentle folk and flyte my kin in the fairy town. 
and what should i make wi blazon and belt wi keep and tail and seizin and fee and what should i do wi page and squire that be a king in my own countrie. 
for i send east and i send west and i send far a my will may flee by dawn and dusk and the drink rain and syne my sending return to me. 
they come wi news of the groanin earth they come wi news o the roarin sea wi word of spirit and ghost and flesh and man that s mazed among the three. 
the king he bite his nether lip and smite his hand upon his knee. by the faith o my soul true thomas he say ye waste no wit in courtesie. 
a i desire unto my pride can i make earl by three and three to run before and ride behind and serve the son o my body. 
and what care i for your row foot earl or all the son o your body. before they win to the pride o name i trow they all ask leave o me. 
for i make honour wi muckle mouth a i make shame wi mincin foot to sing wi the priest at the market cross or run wi the dog in the naked street. 
and some they give me the good red gold and some they give me the white money and some they give me a clout o meal for they be people o low degree. 
and the song i sing for the count gold the same i sing for the white money but best i sing for the clout o meal that simple people give me. 
the king cast down a silver groat a silver groat o scot money if i come with a poor man s dole he say true thomas will ye harp to me. 
whenas i harp to the child small they press me close on either hand. and who be you true thomas say that you should ride while they must stand. 
light down light down from your horse o pride i trow ye talk too loud and hie and i will make you a triple word and syne if ye dare ye shall noble me. 
he ha light down from his horse o pride and set his back against the stone. now guard you well true thomas say ere i rax your heart from your breast bone. 
true thomas play upon his harp the fairy harp that couldna lee and the first least word the proud king hear it harpit the salt tear out o his ee. 
oh i see the love that i lose long syne i touch the hope that i may not see and all that i do o hide shame like little snake they hiss at me. 
the sun be lose at noon at noon. the dread o doom ha grippit me. true thomas hide me under your cloak god wot i m little fit to dee. 
twas bend beneath and blue above twas open field and run flood where hot on heath and dyke and wall the high sun warm the adder s brood. 
lie down lie down true thomas say. the god shall judge when all be do. but i will bring you a good word and lift the cloud that i lay on. 
true thomas play upon his harp that birl and brattle to his hand and the next least word true thomas make it garred the king take horse and brand. 
oh i hear the tread o the fight men i see the sun on splent and spear. i mark the arrow outen the fern. that fly so low and sing so clear. 
advance my standard to that war and bid my good knight prick and ride. the gled shall watch a fierce a fight a e er be fight on the border side. 
twas bend beneath and blue above twas nod grass and naked sky where ring up the wastrel wind the eyas stoop upon the pye. 
true thomas sigh above his harp and turn the song on the midmost string. and the last least word true thomas make he harpit his dead youth back to the king. 
now i be prince and i do well to love my love withouten fear. to walk wi man in fellowship and breathe my horse behind the deer. 
my hound they bay unto the death the buck ha couch beyond the burn my love she wait at her window to wash my hand when i return. 
for that i live be i content. oh. i have see my true love s eye. to stand wi adam in eden glade and run in the wood o paradise. 
twas nod grass and naked sky twas blue above and bend below where check against the wastrel wind the red deer bell to call the doe. 
true thomas lay his harp away and louted low at the saddle side. he ha take stirrup and hauden rein and set the king on his horse o pride. 
sleep ye or wake true thomas say that sit so still that muse so long. sleep ye or wake. till the latter sleep i trow ye ll not forget my song. 
i ha harpit a shadow out o the sun to stand before your face and cry. i ha arm the earth beneath your heel and over your head i ha dusk the sky. 
i ha harpit ye up to the throne o god i ha harpit your secret soul in three. i ha harpit ye down to the hinge o hell and ye would make a knight o me. 
the story of ung. 
once on a glitter ice field age and age ago ung a maker of picture fashion an image of snow. fashion the form of a tribesman gaily he whistle and sing work the snow with his finger. read ye the story of ung. 
please be his tribe with that image come in their hundred to scan handle it smelt it and grunt. verily this be a man. thus do we carry our lance thus be a war belt sling. ay it be even a we be. glory and honour to ung. 
late he picture an aurochs late he picture a bear picture the sabre tooth tiger drag a man to his lair picture the mountainous mammoth hairy abhorrent alone out of the love that he bore them scribe them clearly on bone. 
swift come the tribe to behold them peer and push and still men of the berg batter beach men of the boulder hatch hill hunter and fisher and trapper presently whisper low. yea they be like and it may be. but how doe the picture man know. 
ung hath he sleep with the aurochs watch where the mastodon roam. speak on the ice with the bow head follow the sabre tooth home. nay. these be toy of his fancy. if he have cheat u so how be there truth in his image the man that he fashion of snow. 
wroth be that maker of picture hotly he answer the call. hunter and fisher and trapper child and fool be ye all. look at the beast when ye hunt them. swift from the tumult he break run to the cave of his father and tell him the shame that they speak. 
and the father of ung give answer that be old and wise in the craft maker of picture aforetime he lean on his lance and laugh. if they could see a thou seest they would do what thou hast do and each man would make him a picture and what would become of my son. 
there would be no pelt of the reindeer fling down at thy cave for a gift nor dole of the oily timber that strand with the baltic drift. no store of well drill needle nor ouches of amber pale. no new cut tongue of the bison nor meat of the strand whale. 
_thou hast not toil at the fish when the sodden trammel freeze nor work the war boat outward through the rush of the rock stake sea yet they bring thee fish and plunder full meal and an easy bed and all for the sake of thy picture. and ung hold down his head. 
_thou hast not stand to the aurochs when the red snow reek of the fight. men have no time at the houghing to count his curl aright. and the heart of the hairy mammoth thou sayest they do not see yet they save it whole from the beach and broil the best for thee. 
and now do they press to thy picture with open mouth and eye and a little gift in the doorway and the praise no gift can buy. but sure they have doubt thy picture and that be a grievous stain son that can see so clearly return them their gift again. 
and ung look down at his deerskin their broad shell tasselled band and ung draw downward his mitten and look at his naked hand. and he gloved himself and depart and he hear his father behind. son that can see so clearly rejoice that thy tribe be blind. 
straight on that glitter ice field by the cave of the lose dordogne ung a maker of picture fell to his scribe on bone even to mammoth edition. gaily he whistle and sing bless his tribe for their blindness. heed ye the story of ung. 
the three decker.

full thirty foot she tower from waterline to rail. it cost a watch to steer her and a week to shorten sail. but spite all modern notion i find her first and best the only certain packet for the island of the bless. 
fair hold our breeze behind u twas warm with lover prayer. we d steal will for ballast and a crew of miss heir. they ship a able bastard till the wicked nurse confess and they work the old three decker to the island of the bless. 
carambas and serap√©s we wave to every wind we smoke good corpo bacco when our sweetheart prove unkind. with maid of matchless beauty and parentage unguessed we also take our manner to the island of the bless. 
we ask no social question we pump no hide shame we never talk obstetrics when the little strange come. we leave the lord in heaven we leave the fiend in hell. we weren t exactly yussufs but zuleika didn t tell. 
no moral doubt assail u so when the port we near the villain get his flog at the gangway and we cheer. twas fiddle in the foc sle twas garland on the mast for every one get marry and i go ashore at last. 
i leave em all in couple akissing on the deck. i leave the lover love and the parent sign check. in endless english comfort by county folk caress i leave the old three decker at the island of the bless. 
that route be bar to steamer. you ll never lift again our purple paint headland or the lordly keep of spain. they re just beyond the skyline howe er so far you cruise in a ram you damn you liner with a brace of buck screw.

hull down hull down and under she dwindle to a speck with noise of pleasant music and dance on her deck. all s well all s well aboard her she s drop you far behind with a scent of old world rose through the fog that tie you blind. 
her crew be babe or madman. her port be all to make. you re man by truth and science and you steam for steam s sake. well tinker up your engine you know your business best she s take tire people to the island of the bless.

through many road by me possess he shamble forth in cosmic guise. he be the jester and the jest and he the text himself apply. 
the celt be in his heart and hand the gaul be in his brain and nerve. where cosmopolitanly plan he guard the redskin s dry reserve. 
his easy unswept hearth he lend from labrador to guadeloupe. till elbow out by sloven friend he camp at sufferance on the stoop. 
calm eye he scoff at sword and crown or panic blind stab and slay. blatant he bid the world bow down or cringe beg a crumb of praise. 
or sombre drink at mine and mart he dub his dreary brother king. his hand be black with blood. his heart leap a a babe s at little thing. 
but through the shift of mood and mood mine ancient humour save him whole the cynic devil in his blood that bid him mock his hurry soul. 
that bid him flout the law he make that bid him make the law he flout till daze by many doubt he wake the drum gun that have no doubt. 
that check him foolish hot and fond that chuckle through his deep ire that gild the slough of his despond but dim the goal of his desire. 
inopportune shrill accent the acrid asiatic mirth that leaf him careless mid his dead the scandal of the elder earth. 
how shall he clear himself how reach our bar or weigh defence prefer a brother hedge with alien speech and lack all interpreter. 
which knowledge vex him a space. but while reproof around him ring he turn a keen untroubled face home to the instant need of thing. 
enslave illogical elate he greet th embarrass god nor fear to shake the iron hand of fate or match with destiny for beer. 
lo. imperturbable he rule unkempt disreputable vast and in the teeth of all the school i i shall save him at the last.

keep away from dirtiness keep away from mess. don t get into doin thing rather more or le. let s ha do with abby nay kul an hazar ho. mind you keep your rifle an yourself jus so.

when earth s last picture be paint and the tube be twist and dry when the old colour have fade and the young critic ha die we shall rest and faith we shall need it lie down for an √¶on or two till the master of all good workman shall set u to work anew. 
and those that be good shall be happy. they shall sit in a golden chair. they shall splash at a ten league canvas with brush of comet hair. they shall find real saint to draw from magdalene peter and paul. they shall work for an age at a sit and never be tire at all. 
and only the master shall praise u and only the master shall blame. and no one shall work for money and no one shall work for fame. but each for the joy of the work and each in his separate star shall draw the thing a he see it for the god of thing a they be.
