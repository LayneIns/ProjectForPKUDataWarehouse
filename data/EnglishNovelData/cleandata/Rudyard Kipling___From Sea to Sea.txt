nov. dec. 
except for those who under compulsion of a sick certificate be fly bombaywards it be good for every man to see some little of the great indian empire and the strange folk who move about it. it be good to escape for a time from the house of rimmon be it office or cutchery and to go abroad under no more exact master than personal inclination and with no more definite plan of travel than ha the horse escape from pasture free upon the countryside. the first result of such freedom be extreme bewilderment and the second reduce the free to a state of mind which for his sin must be the normal portion of the globe trotter the man who doe kingdom in day and write book upon them in week. and this desperate facility be not a strange a it seem. by the time that an englishman ha come by sea and rail via america japan singapur and ceylon to india he can these eye have see him do so master in five minute the intricacy of the indian bradshaw_ and tell an old resident exactly how and where the train run. can we wonder that the intoxication of success in hasty assimilation should make him overbold and that he should try to grasp but a full account of the insolent globe trotter must be reserve. he be worthy of a book. give absolute freedom for a month the mind a i have say fail to take in the situation and after much debate content itself with follow in old and well beat way path that we in india have no time to tread but must leave to the country cousin who wear his pagri tail fashion down his back and say cabman to the driver of the ticca ghari. 
now jeypore from the anglo indian point of view be a station on the rajputana malwa line on the way to bombay where half an hour be allow for dinner and where there ought to be more protection from the sun than at present exist. some few more learn than the rest know that garnet come from jeypore and here the limit of our wisdom be set. we do not to quote the calcutta shopkeeper come out for the good of our ealth and what tour we accomplish be for the most part off the line of rail. 
for these reason and because he wish to study our winter bird of passage one of the few thousand englishman in india on a date and in a place which have no concern with the story sacrifice all his self respect and become at enormous personal inconvenience a globe trotter go to jeypore and leave behind him for a little while all that old and well know life in which commissioner and deputy commissioner governor and lieutenant governor aide de camp colonel and their wife major captain and subaltern after their kind move and rule and govern and squabble and fight and sell each other s horse and tell wicked story of their neighbour. but before he have fully settle into his part or accustom himself to say please take out this luggage to the cooly at the station he saw from the train the taj wrap in the mist of the morning. 
there be a story of a frenchman who fear not god nor regard man sail to egypt for the express purpose of scoff at the pyramid and though this be hard to believe at the great napoleon who have war under their shadow. it be on record that that blasphemous gaul come to the great pyramid and weep through mingle reverence and contrition. for he spring from an emotional race. to understand his feeling it be necessary to have read a great deal too much about the taj it design and proportion. to have see execrable picture of it at the simla fine art exhibition to have have it praise sing by superior and travel friend till the brain loathe the repetition of the word. and then sulky with want of sleep heavy eye unwashed and chill to come upon it suddenly. under these circumstance everything you will concede be in favour of a cold critical and not too impartial verdict. a the englishman lean out of the carriage he saw first an opal tint cloud on the horizon and late certain tower. the mist lay on the grind so that the splendour seem to be float free of the earth. and the mist rise in the background so that at no time could everything be see clearly. then a the train speed forward and the mist shift and the sun shine upon the mist the taj take a hundred new shape each perfect and each beyond description. it be the ivory gate through which all good dream come. it be the realization of the gleam hall of dawn that tennyson sing of. it be veritably the aspiration fix the sigh make stone of a less poet. and over and above concrete comparison it seem the embodiment of all thing pure all thing holy and all thing unhappy. that be the mystery of the build. it may be that the mist work the witchery and that the taj see in the dry sunlight be only a guide book say a noble structure. the englishman could not tell and ha make a vow that he will never go near the spot for fear of break the charm of the unearthly pavilion. 
it may be too that each must view the taj for himself with his own eye work out his own interpretation of the sight. it be certain that no man can in cold blood and cold ink set down his impression if he ha be in the least move. 
to the one who watch and wonder that november morning the thing seem full of sorrow the sorrow of the man who build it for the woman he love and the sorrow of the workman who die in the build use up like cattle. and in the face of this sorrow the taj flush in the sunlight and be beautiful after the beauty of a woman who ha do no wrong. 
here the train run in under the wall of agra fort and another train of think incoherent a that write above come to an end. let those who scoff at overmuch enthusiasm look at the taj and thenceforward be dumb. it be well on the threshold of a journey to be teach reverence and awe. 
but there be no reverence in the globe trotter. he be brazen. a young man from manchester be travel to bombay in order how the word hurt. to be home by christmas. he have come through america new zealand and australia and find that he have ten day to spare at bombay conceive the modest idea of do india. i don t say that i ve do it all. but you may say that i ve see a good deal. then he explain that he have be much please at agra. much please at delhi. and last profanation very much please at the taj. indeed he seem to be go through life just then much please at everything. with rare and sparkle originality he remark that india be a big place and that there be many thing to buy. verily this young man must have be a delight to the delhi boxwallahs. he have purchase shawl and embroidery to the tune of a certain number of rupee duly set forth and he have purchase jewellery to another tune. these be gift for friend at home and he consider them very eastern. if silver filigree work model on palais royal pattern or aniline blue scarf be eastern he have succeed in his heart s desire. for some inscrutable end it have be decree that man shall take a delight in make his fellow man miserable. the englishman begin to point out gravely the probable extent to which the young man from manchester have be swindle and the young man say. by jove. you don t say so. i hate be do. if there s anything i hate it s be do. 
he have be so happy in the think of get home by christmas and so charmingly communicative a to the member of his family for whom such and such gift be intend that the englishman cut short the record of fraud and soothe him by say that he have not be so very badly do after all. this consideration be misplace for his peace of mind restore the young man from manchester look out of the window and wave his hand over the empire generally say. i say. look here. all those well be wrong you know. the well be on the wheel and incline plane system. but he object to the incline and say that it would be much good for the bullock if they walk on level grind. then light dawn upon him and he say. i suppose it s to exercise all their muscle. y know a canal horse be no use after he ha be on the tow path for some time. he can t walk anywhere but on the flat y know and i suppose it s just the same with bullock. the spur of the aravalis under which the train be run have evidently suggest this brilliant idea which pass uncontradicted for the englishman be look out of the window. 
if one be bold enough to generalise after the manner of globe trotter it would be easy to build up a theory on the well incident to account for the apparent insanity of some of our cold weather visitor. even the young man from manchester could evolve a complete idea for the train of well bullock in the east at thirty second notice. how much the more could a cultivate observer from let u say an english constituency blunder and pervert and mangle. we in this country have no time to work out the notion which be worthy of the consideration of some leisurely teuton intellect. 
envy may have prompt a too bitter judgment of the young man from manchester. for a the train bore him from jeypore to ahmedabad happy in his get home by christmas please a a child with his delhi atrocity pink cheek whisker and superbly self confident the englishman whose home for the time be a dark bungaloathsome hotel watch his departure regretfully. for he know exactly to what sort of genial cheery british household rich in untravelled kin that young man be speed. it be pleasant to play at globe trot. but to enter fully into the spirit of the piece one must also be go home for christmas. 
ii. 
show the charm of rajputana and of jeypore the city of the globe trotter. of it founder and it embellishment. explain the use and destiny of the stud breed and fail to explain many more important matter. 
if any part of a land strew with dead men s bone have a special claim to distinction rajputana a the cock pit of india stand first. east of suez men do not build tower on the top of hill for the sake of the view nor do they stripe the mountain side with bastioned stone wall to keep in cattle. since the begin of time if we be to credit the legend there be fight heroic fight at the foot of the aravalis and beyond in the great desert of sand pen by those kindly mountain from spread over the heart of india. the thirty six royal race fight a royal race know how to do chohan with rahtor brother against brother son against father. late but excerpt from the tangle tale of force fraud cunning desperate love and more desperate revenge crime worthy of demon and virtue fit for god may be find by all who care to look in the book of the man who love the rajput and give a life s labour in their behalf. from delhi to abu and from the indus to the chambul each yard of grind ha witness slaughter pillage and rapine. but to day the capital of the state that dhola rae son of soora singh hack out more than nine hundred year ago with the sword from some weak ruler s realm be light with gas and posse many strike and english peculiarity. 
dhola rae be kill in due time and for nine hundred year jeypore tear by the intrigue of unruly prince and princeling fight asiatically. 
when and how jeypore become a feudatory of british power and in what manner we put a slur upon rajput honour punctilious a the honour of the pathan be matter of which the globe trotter know more than we do. he read up to quote his own word a city before he come to u and straightway go to another city forget or bad still mix what he ha learn so that in the end he write down the rajput a mahratta say that lahore be in the northwest province and be once the capital of sivaji and piteously demand a guide book on all india a thing that you can carry in your trunk y know that give you plain description of thing without mix you up. here be a chance for a writer of discrimination and void of conscience. 
but to return to jeypore a pink city set on the border of a blue lake and surround by the low red spur of the aravalis a city to see and to puzzle over. there be once a ruler of the state call jey singh who live in the day of aurungzeb and do him service with foot and horse. he must have be the solomon of rajputana for through the forty four year of his reign his wisdom remain with him. he lead army and when fight be over turn to literature. he intrigue desperately and successfully but find time to gain a deep insight into astronomy and by what remain above grind now we can tell that whatsoever his eye desire he keep not from him. know his own worth he desert the city of amber found by dhola rae among the hill and six mile further in the open plain bid one vedyadhar his architect build a new city a seldom indian city be build before with huge street straight a an arrow sixty yard broad and cross street broad and straight. many year afterward the good people of america build their town after this pattern but know nothing of jey singh they take all the credit to themselves. 
he build himself everything that please him palace and garden and temple and then die and be bury under a white marble tomb on a hill overlook the city. he be a traitor if history speak truth to his own kin and he be an accomplish murderer. but he do his best to check infanticide he reform the mahometan calendar. he pile up a superb library and he make jeypore a marvel. 
late on come a successor educate and enlighten by all the lamp of british progress and convert the city of jey singh into a surprise a big bewilder practical joke. he lay down sumptuous trottoirs of hew stone and central carriage drive also of hew stone in the main street he that be to say colonel jacob the superintend engineer of the state devise a water supply for the city and stud the way with standpipe. he build gas work set afoot a school of art a museum all the thing in fact which be necessary to western municipal welfare and comfort and saw that they be the best of their kind. how much colonel jacob ha do not only for the good of jeypore city but for the good of the state at large will never be know because the officer in question be one of the not small class who resolutely refuse to talk about their own work. the result of the good work be that the old and the new the rampantly raw and the sullenly old stand cheek by jowl in startle contrast. thus the sacred bull of shira trip over the rail of a steel tramway which bring out the city rubbish. the lacquer and paint cart behind the two little stag like trot bullock catch it primitive wheel in the cast iron gas lamp post with the brass nozzle atop and all rajputana gayly clothe small turbaned swagger rajputana circulate along the magnificent pavement. 
the fortress crown hill look down upon the strange medley. one of them bear on it flank in huge white letter the cheery inscription welcome. this be make when the prince of wale visit jeypore to shoot his first tiger. but the average traveller of to day may appropriate the message to himself for jeypore take great care of stranger and show them all courtesy. this by the way demoralise the globe trotter whose first cry be where can we get horse. where can we get elephant. who be the man to write to for all these thing. 
thank to the courtesy of the maharaja it be possible to see everything but for the incurious who object to be drive through their sight a journey down any one of the great main street be a day s delightful occupation. the view be a unobstructed a that of the champ √©lys√©es. but in place of the white stone front of paris rise a long line of open work screen wall the prevail tone of which be pink caramel pink but house owner have unlimited license to decorate their tenement a they please. jeypore broadly consider be hindu and her architecture of the riotous many arch type which even the globe trotter after a short time learn to call hindu. it be neither temperate nor noble but it satisfy the general desire for something that really look indian. 
a perverse taste for low company draw the englishman from the pavement to walk upon a real stone pavement be in itself a privilege up a side street where he assist at a quail fight and find the low caste rajput a cheery and affable soul. the owner of the lose quail be a trooper in the maharaja s army. he explain that his pay be six rupee a month pay bimonthly. he have to pay the cost of his khaki blouse brown leather accoutrement and jack boot. lance saddle sword and horse be give free. he refuse to tell for how many month in the year he be drill and say vaguely that his duty be mainly escort one and he have no fault to find with them. the defeat of his quail have vex him and he desire the sahib to understand that the sowars of his highness s army could ride. a clumsy attempt at a compliment so fire his martial blood that he climb into his saddle and then and there insist on show off his horsemanship. the road be narrow the lance be long and the horse be a big one but no one object and the englishman sit him down on a doorstep and watch the fun. the horse seem in some shadowy way familiar. his head be not the lean head of the kathiawar nor his crest the crest of the marwarri and his foreleg do not belong to these stony district. where do he come from. the sowar point northward and say from amritsar but he pronounce it armtzar. many horse have be buy at the spring fair in the punjab. they cost about two hundred rupee each perhaps more the sowar could not say. some come from hissar and some from other place beyond delhi. they be very good horse. that horse there he point to one a little distance down the street be the son of a big government horse the kind that the sirkar make for breed horse so high. the owner of that horse swagger up jaw bandage and cat moustached and bid the englishman look at his mount. buy of course when a colt. both men together say that the sahib have good examine the maharaja sahib s stable where there be hundred of horse huge a elephant or tiny a sheep. 
to the stable the englishman accordingly go know beforehand what he would find and wonder whether the sirkar s big horse be mean to get mount for rajput sowars. the maharaja s stable be royal in size and appointment. the enclosure round which they stand must be about half a mile long it allow ample space for exercise besides paddock for the colt. the horse about two hundred and fifty be bed in pure white sand bad for the coat if they roll but good for the foot the picket be of white marble the heel rope in every case of good sound rope and in every case the stable be exquisitely clean. each stall contain above the manger a curious little bunk for the syce who if he us the accommodation must assuredly die once each hot weather. 
a journey round the stable be sadden for the attendant be very anxious to strip their charge and the strip show so much. a few men in india be credit with the faculty of never forget a horse they have once see and of know the produce of every stallion they have meet. the englishman would have give something for their company at that hour. his knowledge of horse flesh be very limit. but he felt certain that more than one or two of the sleek perfectly groom country breds should have be justify their existence in the rank of the british cavalry instead of eat their head off on six seers[ ] of gram and one of sugar per diem. but they have all be honestly buy and honestly pay for. and there be nothing in the wide world to prevent his highness if he wish to do so from sweep up the pick and pride of all the stud breed horse in the punjab. the attendant appear to take a wicked delight in say eshtud breed [ ] very loudly and with unnecessary emphasis a they throw back the loin cloth. sometimes they be wrong but in too many case they be right. 
[ ] a seer be about two pound. 
[ ] stud breed i. e. breed at the indian government stud. 
the englishman leave the stable and the great central maidan where a nervous biluchi be be teach by a perfect network of rope to monkey jump and go out into the street reflect on the work of horse breed operation under the government of india and the advantage of have unlimited money wherewith to profit by other people s mistake. 
then a happen to the great tartarin of tarescon wild beast begin to roar and a crowd of little boy laugh. the lion of jeypore be tiger cage in a public place for the sport of the people who hiss at them and disturb their royal feeling. two or three of the six great brute be magnificent. all of them be short temper and the bar of their captivity not too strong. a pariah dog be furtively try to scratch out a fragment of meat from between the bar of one of the cage and the occupant tolerate him. grow bold the starveling growl. the tiger strike at him with his paw and the dog flee howl with fear. when he return he bring two friend with him and the three mock the captive from a distance. 
it be not a pleasant sight and suggest globe trotter gentleman who imagine that more curricles should come at their bid and on be undeceive become abusive. 
iii. 
doe not in any sort describe the dead city of amber but give detail information about a cotton press. 
and what shall be say of amber queen of the pas the city that jey singh bid his people slough a snake cast their skin. the globe trotter will assure you that it must be do before anything else and the globe trotter be for once perfectly correct. amber lie between six and seven mile from jeypore among the tumble fragment of the hill and be reachable by so prosaic a conveyance a a ticca ghari_ and so uncomfortable a one a an elephant. he be provide by the maharaja and the people who make india their prey be apt to accept his service a a matter of course. 
rise very early in the morning before the star have go out and drive through the sleep city till the pavement give place to cactus and sand and educational and enlighten institution to mile upon mile of semi decay hindu temple brown and weather beat run down to the shore of the great man sagar lake wherein be more ruin temple palace and fragment of causeway. the water bird have their home in the half submerge arcade and the crocodile nuzzle the shaft of the pillar. it be a fit prelude to the desolation of amber. beyond the man sagar the road of to day climb up hill and by it side run the huge stone causeway of yesterday block sink in concrete. down this path the sword of amber go out to kill. a triple wall ring the city and at the third gate the road drop into the valley of amber. in the half light of dawn a great city sink between hill and build round three side of a lake be dimly visible and one wait to catch the hum that should arise from it a the day break. the air in the valley be bitterly chill. with the grow light amber stand reveal and the traveller see that it be a city that will never wake. a few beggar live in hut at the end of the valley but the temple the shrine the palace and the tier on tier of house be desolate. tree grow upon and split the wall the window be fill with brushwood and the cactus choke the street. the englishman make his way up the side of the hill to the great palace that overlook everything except the red fort of jeighur guardian of amber. a the elephant swing up the steep road pave with stone and build out on the side of the hill he look into empty house where the little grey squirrel sit and scratch it ear. the peacock walk on the house top and the blue pigeon roost within. he pass under iron stud gate whose hinge be eat out with rust and by wall plume and crown with grass and under more gate way till at last he reach the palace and come suddenly into a great quadrangle where two blind arrogant stallion cover with red and gold trapping scream and neigh at each other from opposite end of the vast space. for a little time these be the only visible live being and they be in perfect accord with the spirit of the spot. afterwards certain workman appear. for it seem that the maharaja keep the old palace of his forefather in good repair but they be modern and mercenary and with great difficulty be detach from the skirt of the traveller. a somewhat extensive experience of palace see have teach him that it be best to see palace alone for the oriental a a guide be undiscriminating and set too great a store on corrugate iron roof and glaze drain pipe. 
so the englishman go into this palace build of stone bed on stone spring out of scarped rock and reach by stone way nothing but stone. presently he stumble across a little temple of kali a gem of marble tracery and inlay very dark and at that hour of the morning very cold. 
if a viollet le duc tell u to believe a build reflect the character of it inhabitant it must be impossible for one rear in an eastern palace to think straightly or speak freely or but here the annals of rajputana contradict the theory to act openly. the cramp and darken room the narrow smooth wall passage with recess where a man might wait for his enemy unseen the maze of ascend and descend stair lead nowhither the ever present screen of marble tracery that may hide or reveal so much all these thing breathe of plot and counter plot league and intrigue. in a live palace where the sightseer know and feel that there be human being everywhere and that he be follow by score of unseen eye the impression be almost unendurable. in a dead palace a cemetery of love and hatred do with hundred of year ago and of plottings that have for their end though the greybeard who plot know it not the come of the british tourist with guide book and sun hat oppression give place to simply impertinent curiosity. the englishman wander into all part of the palace for there be no one to stop him not even the ghost of the dead queen through ivory stud door into the woman s quarter where a stream of water once flow over a chisel marble channel. a creeper have set it hand upon the lattice there and there be dust of old nest in one of the niche in the wall. do the lady of light virtue who manage to become possess of so great a portion of jey singh s library ever set her dainty foot in the trim garden of the hall of pleasure beyond the screen work. be it in the forty pillared hall of audience that the order go forth that the chief of birjooghar be to be slay and from what wall do the king look out when the horseman clatter up the steep stone path to the palace bear on their saddle bow the head of the brave of rajore. there be question innumerable to be ask in each court and keep and cell. but the only answer be the coo of the pigeon. 
if a man desire beauty there be enough and to spare in the palace. and of strength more than enough. with inlay and carve marble with glass and colour the king who take their pleasure in that now desolate pile make all that their eye rest upon royal and superb. but any description of the artistic side of the palace if it be not impossible would be wearisome. the wise man will visit it when time and occasion serve and will then in some small measure understand what must have be the riotous sumptuous murderous life to which our governor and lieutenant governor commissioner and deputy commissioner colonel and captain and the subaltern have put an end. 
from the top of the palace you may read if you please the book of ezekiel write in stone upon the hillside. come up the englishman have see the city from below or on a level. he now look into it very heart the heart that have cease to beat. there be no sound of men or cattle or grind stone in those pitiful street nothing but the coo of the pigeon. at first it seem that the palace be not ruin at all that soon the woman would come up on the house top and the bell would ring in the temple. but a he attempt to follow with his eye the turn of the street the englishman saw that they die out in wood tangle and block of fall stone that some of the house be rent with great crack and pierce from roof to road with hole that let in the morning sun. the drip stone of the eaves be gap toothed and the tracery of the screen have fall out so that zenana room lay shamelessly open to the day. on the outskirt of the city the strong wall house dwindle and sink down to mere stone heap and faint indication of plinth and wall hard to trace against the background of stony soil. the shadow of the palace lay over two third of the city and the tree deepen the shadow. he who ha bend him o er the dead after the hour of which byron sing know that the feature of the man become blunt a it be the face begin to fade. the same hideous look lie on the face of the queen of the pas and when once this be realise the eye wonder that it could have ever believe in the life of her. she be the city whose graf be set in the side of the pit and her company be round about her graf sister of pathros zoan and no. 
move by a thoroughly insular instinct the englishman take up a piece of plaster and heave it from the palace wall into the dark street. it bound from a house top to a window ledge and thence into a little square and the sound of it fall be hollow and echo a the sound of a stone in a well. then the silence close up upon the sound till in the far away courtyard below the rope stallion begin scream afresh. there may be desolation in the great indian desert to the westward and there be desolation on the open sea. but the desolation of amber be beyond the loneliness either of land or sea. men by the hundred thousand must have toil at the wall that bind it the temple and bastion that stud the wall the fort that overlook all the canal that once lift water to the palace and the garden in the lake of the valley. renan could describe it a it stand to day and verestchaguin could paint it. 
arrive at this satisfactory conclusion the englishman go down through the palace and the score of venomous and suggestive little room to the elephant in the courtyard and be take back in due time to the nineteenth century in the shape of his highness the maharaja s cotton press return a profit of twenty seven per cent and fit with two engine of fifty horse power each an hydraulic press capable of exert a pressure of three ton per square inch and everything else to correspond. it stand under a neat corrugate iron roof close to the jeypore railway station and be in most perfect order but somehow it do not taste well after amber. there be aggressiveness about the engine and the smell of the raw cotton. 
the modern side of jeypore must not be mix with the ancient. 
iv. 
the temple of mahadeo and the manner of such a see india. the man by the water trough and his knowledge. the voice of the city and what it say. personality and the hospital. the house beautiful of jeypore and it builder. 
from the cotton press the englishman wander through the wide street till he come into an hindu temple rich in marble stone and inlay and a deep and tranquil silence close to the public library of the state. the brazen bull be hang with flower and men be burn the even incense before mahadeo. while those who have pray their prayer beat upon the bell hang from the roof and pass out secure in the knowledge that the god have hear them. if there be much religion there be little reverence a western understand the term at the service of the god of the east. a tiny little maiden child of a monstrously ugly wall eye priest stagger across the marble pavement to the shrine and throw with a gust of childish laughter the blossom she be carry into the lap of the great mahadeo himself. then she make a though she would leap up to the bell and run away still laugh into the shadow of the cell behind the shrine while her father explain that she be but a baby and that mahadeo would take no notice. the temple he say be specially favour by the maharaja and draw from land an income of twenty thousand rupee a year. thakoors and great men also give gift out of their benevolence. and there be nothing in the wide world to prevent an englishman from follow their example. 
by this time for amber and the cotton press have fill the hour night be fall and the priest unhook the swing jet and begin to light up the impassive face of mahadeo with gas. they use swedish match. 
full night bring the hotel and it curiously compose human menagerie. 
there be if a work a day world will believe a society entirely outside and unconnected with that of the station a planet within a planet where nobody know anything about the collector s wife the colonel s dinner party or what be really the matter with the engineer. it be a curious an insatiably curious thing and it literature be newman s bradshaw. wander old arm seller and others live upon it and so do the garnetmen and the maker of ancient rajput shield. the world of the innocent abroad be a touch and unsophisticated place and it very atmosphere urge the anglo indian unconsciously to an extravagant mendacity. can you wonder then that a guide of long stand should in time grow to be an accomplish liar. 
into this world sometimes break the anglo indian return from leave or a fugitive to the sea and his presence be like that of a well know land mark in the desert. the old arm seller know and avoid him and he be detest by the jobber of gharis who call every one my lord in english and pander to the glare race anomaly by say that every carriage not under his control be rotten my lord have be use by native. one of the privilege of play at tourist be the brevet rank of lord. 
there be many and some very curious method of see india. one of these be buy english translation of the more zolaistic of zola s novel and read them from breakfast to dinner time in the verandah. yet another even simple be american in it conception. take a newman s bradshaw and a blue pencil and race up and down the length of the empire tick off the name of the station do. to do this thoroughly keep strictly to the railway building and form your conclusion through the carriage window. these eye have see both way of work in full blast. and on the whole the first be the most commendable. 
let u consider now with due reverence the modern side of jeypore. it be difficult to write of a nickel plat civilisation set down under the immemorial aravalis in the first state of rajputana. the red grey hill seem to laugh at it and the ever shift sand dune under the hill take no account of it for they advance upon the base of the monogrammed coronet crown lamp post and fill up the point of the natty tramway near the waterworks which be the outpost of the civilisation of jeypore. 
escape from the city by the railway station till you meet the cactus and the mud bank and the maharaja s cotton press. pas between a tramway and a trough for wayfaring camel till your foot sink ankle deep in soft sand and you come upon what seem to be the fringe of illimitable desert mound upon mound of tussock overgrow with plume grass where the parrot sit and swing. here if you have keep to the road you shall find a dam face with stone a great tank and pump machinery fine a the heart of a municipal engineer can desire pure water sound pipe and well keep engine. if you belong to what be sarcastically style an able and intelligent municipality under the british rule go down to the level of the tank scoop up the water in your hand and drink think meanwhile of the defect of the town whence you come. the experience will be a profitable one. there be statistic in connection with the waterworks figure relate to three throw plunger delivery and supply which should be know to the professional reader. they would not interest the unprofessional who would learn his lesson among the throng standpipe of the city. 
while the englishman be prepare in his mind a scathing rebuke for an err municipality that he know of a camel swing across the sand it driver s jaw and brow bind mummy fashion to guard against the dust. the man be evidently a strange to the place for he pull up and ask the englishman where the drink trough be. he be a gentleman and bore very patiently with the englishman s absurd ignorance of his dialect. he have come from some village with an unpronounceable name thirty ko away to see his brother s son who be sick in the big hospital. while the camel be drink the man talk lie back along his mount. he know nothing of jeypore except the name of certain englishman in it the men who he say have make the waterworks and build the hospital for his brother s son s comfort. 
and this be the curious feature of jeypore. though happily the city be not unique in it peculiarity. when the late maharaja ascend the throne more than fifty year ago it be his royal will and pleasure that jeypore should advance. whether he be prompt by love for his subject desire for praise or the magnificent vanity with which jey singh must have be so largely dower be question that concern nobody. in the latter year of his reign he be supply with englishman who make the state their fatherland and identify themselves with it progress a only englishman can. behind them stand the maharaja ready to spend money with a lavishness that no supreme government would dream of. and it would not be too much to say that they together make the state what it be. when ram singh die madho singh his successor a conservative hindu forbear to interfere in any way with the work that be go forward. it be say in the city that he doe not overburden himself with the care of state the drive power be mainly in the hand of a bengali who ha everything but the name of minister. nor do the englishman it be say in the city mix themselves with the business of government. their business be wholly executive. 
they can accord to the voice of the city do what they please and the voice of the city not in the main road but in the little side alley where the stall le bull block the path attest how well their pleasure ha suit the pleasure of the people. in truth to men of action few thing could be more delightful than have a state of fifteen thousand square mile place at their disposal a it be to leave their mark on. unfortunately for the vagrant traveller those who work hard for practical end prefer not to talk about their do and he must therefore pick up what information he can at second hand or in the city. the men at the standpipe explain that the maharaja sahib s father give the order for the waterworks and that yakub. jacob. sahib make them not only in the city but out away in the district. do the people grow more crop thereby. of course they do. be canal make only to wash in. how much more crop. who know. the sahib have good go and ask some official. increase irrigation mean increase of revenue for the state somewhere but the man who bring about the increase doe not say so. 
after a few day of amateur globe trot a shamelessness great a that of the other loafer the red nose man who hang about one garden and be always on the eve of start for calcutta posse the masquerader. so that he feel equal to ask a resident for a parcel gild howdah or drop into dinner with a lieutenant governor. no man ha a right to keep anything back from a globe trotter who be a mild temperate gentlemanly and unobtrusive seeker after truth. therefore he who without a word of enlightenment send the visitor into a city which he himself ha beautify and adorn and make clean and wholesome deserve unsparing exposure. and the city may be trust to betray him. the malli in the ram newas garden garden which be fine than any in india and fit to rank with the best in paris say that the maharaja give the order and yakub sahib make the garden. he also say that the hospital just outside the garden be build by yakub sahib and if the sahib will go to the centre of the garden he will find another big build a museum by the same hand. 
but the englishman go first to the hospital and find the out patient begin to arrive. a hospital cannot tell lie about it own progress a a municipality can. sick folk either come or lie in their own village. in the case of the mayo hospital they come and the operation book show that they have be in the habit of come. doctor at issue with provincial and local administration civil surgeon who cannot get their indent comply with grind down and mutinous practitioner all india over would do well to visit the mayo hospital jeypore. they might in the exceed bitterness of their envy be able to point out some defect in it supply or it bed or it splint or in the absolute isolation of the woman s quarter from the men s. 
from the hospital the englishman go to the museum in the centre of the garden and be eat up by it for museum appeal to him. the case of the jewel be in the first place superb a wonder of carven white stone of the indo saracenic style. it stand on a stone plinth and be rich in stone tracery green marble column from ajmir red marble white marble colonnade court with fountain richly carve wooden door fresco inlay and colour. the ornamentation of the tomb of delhi the palace of agra and the wall of amber have be lay under contribution to supply the design in bracket arch and soffit. and stone mason from the jeypore school of art have weave into the work the best that their hand could produce. the build in essence if not in the fact of to day be the work of freemason. the men be allow a certain scope in their choice of detail and the result but it should be see to be understand a it stand in those imperial garden. and observe the man who have design it who have superintend it erection have say no word to indicate that there be such a thing in the place or that every foot of it from the dome of the roof to the cool green chunam dado and the carve of the rim of the fountain in the courtyard be worth study. round the arch of the great centre court be write in sanskrit and hindi text from the great hindu writer of old bear on the beauty of wisdom and the sanctity of true knowledge. 
in the central corridor be six great fresco each about nine foot by five copy of illustration in the royal folio of the razmnameh_ the mahabharata_ which abkar cause to be do by the best artist of his day. the original be in the museum and he who can steal it will find a purchaser at any price up to fifty thousand pound. 
v. 
of the sordidness of the supreme government on the revenue side. and of the palace of jeypore. a great king s pleasure house and the work of the servant of state. 
internally there be in all honesty no limit to the luxury of the jeypore museum. it revel in south kensington case of the approve pattern that turn the beholder homesick and south kensington label whereon the description measurement and price of each object be fairly print. these make savage one who know how label be bungle in some of the government museum our starve barn that be suppose to hold the economic exhibit not of little state but of great province. 
the floor be of dark red chunam overlay with a discreet and silent mat. the door where they be not plate glass be of carve wood no two alike hinge by sumptuous brass hinge on to marble jamb and open without noise. on the carve marble pillar of each hall be fix revolve case of the south kensington pattern to show textile fabric gold lace and the like. in the recess of the wall be more case and on the rail of the gallery that run round each of the three great central room be fix low case to hold natural history specimen and wax model of fruit and vegetable. 
hear this government of india from the punjab to madras. the door come true to the jamb the case which have be through a hot weather be neither warp nor crack nor be there unseemly tallow drop and flaw in the glass. the maroon cloth on or against which the exhibit be place be of close texture untouched by the moth neither stain nor meagre nor sunfaded. the revolve case revolve freely without rattle. there be not a speck of dust from one end of the build to the other because the menial staff be numerous enough to keep everything clean and the curator s office be a veritable office not a shed or a bath room or a loose box partition from the main build. these thing be so because money ha be spend on the museum and it be now a rebuke to all other museum in india from calcutta downwards. whether it be not too good to be bury away in a native state be a question which envious men may raise and answer a they choose. not long ago the editor of a bombay paper pass through it but have the interest of the egocentric presidency before his eye dwell more upon the idea of the build than it structural beauty. say that bombay who profess a weakness for technical education should be ashamed of herself. and he be quite right. 
the system of the museum be complete in intention a be it appointment in design. at present there be some fifteen thousand object of art cover a complete exposition of the art from enamel to pottery and from brass ware to stone carve of the state of jeypore. they be compare with similar art of other land. thus a damio s sword a gem of lacquer plat silk and stud work flank the tulwars of marwar and the jezails of tonk. and reproduction of persian and russian brass work stand side by side with the handicraft of the pupil of the jeypore school of art. a photograph of his highness the present maharaja be set among the arm which be the most prominent feature of the first or metal room. a the villager enter they salaam reverently to the photo and then move on slowly with an evidently intelligent interest in what they see. ruskin could describe the scene admirably point out how reverence must precede the study of art and how it be good for englishman and rajput alike to bow on occasion before geisler s cap. they thumb the revolve case of cloth do those rustic and artlessly try to feel the texture through the protect glass. the main object of the museum be avowedly provincial to show the craftsman of jeypore the best that his predecessor could do and what foreign artist have do. in time but the curator of the museum ha many scheme which will assuredly bear fruit in time and it would be unfair to divulge them. let those who doubt the thoroughness of a museum under one man s control build fill and endow with royal generosity an institution perfectly independent of the government of india go and exhaustively visit dr. hendley s charge at jeypore. like the man who make the build he refuse to talk and so the great part of the work that he ha in hand must be guess at. 
at one point indeed the curator be take off his guard. a huge map of the kingdom show in green the portion that have be bring under irrigation while blue circle mark the town that own dispensary. i want to bring every man in the state within twenty mile of a dispensary and i ve nearly do it say he. then he check himself and go off to food grain in little bottle a be neutral and colourless thing. envy be force to admit that the arrangement of the museum far too important a matter to be explain off hand be continental in it character and ha a definite end and bear a trifle omit by many institution other than museum. but in fine what can one say of a collection whose very label be gild edge. shameful extravagance. nothing of the kind only finish perfectly in keep with the rest of the fitting a finish that we in kutcha_[ ] india have fail to catch. 
[ ] casual. half finish. 
from the museum go out through the city to the maharaja s palace skilfully avoid the man who would show you the maharaja s european billiard room and wander through a wilderness of sunlit sleepy court gay with paint and fresco till you reach an inner square where smile grey beard men squat at ease and play chaupur_[ ] just such a game a cost the pandavs the fair draupadi with inlay dice and gayly lacquer piece. these ancient be very polite and will press you to play but give no heed to them for chaupur be an expensive game expensive a quail fight when you have back the wrong bird and the people be laugh at your inexperience. the maharaja s palace be gay overwhelmingly rich in candelabra paint ceiling gild mirror and other evidence of a too hastily assimilate civilisation. but if the evidence of the ear can be trust the old old game of intrigue go on a merrily a of yore. a figure in saffron come out of a dark arch into the sunlight almost fall into the arm of one in pink. where have you come from. i have be to see the name be unintelligible. that be a lie. you have not. then across the court some one laugh a low croak laugh. the pink and saffron figure separate a though they have be shoot and disappear into separate bolt hole. it be a curious little incident and might have mean a great deal or just nothing at all. it distract the attention of the ancient bow above the chaupur cloth. 
[ ] something like parchesi. 
in the palace garden there be even a great stillness than that about the court and here nothing of the west unless a critical soul might take exception to the lamp post. at the extreme end lie a lake like tank swarm with mugger. [ ] it be reach through an open under a block of zenana building. remember that all beast by the palace of king or the temple of priest in this country would answer to the name of brother the englishman cry with the voice of faith across the water. and the mysterious freemasonry do not fail. at the far end of the tank rise a ripple that grow and grow and grow like a thing in a nightmare and become presently an age mugger. a he near the shore there emerge the green slime thick upon his eyelid another beast and the two together snap at a cigar butt the only reward for their courtesy. then disgust they sink stern first with a gentle sigh. now a mugger s sigh be the most suggestive sound in animal speech. it suggest first the zenana building overhead the wall pass through the purple hill beyond a horse that might clatter through the pass till he reach the man sagar lake below the pass and a boat that might row across the man sagar till it nose the wall of the palace tank and then then uprise the mugger with the filth upon his forehead and wink one horny eyelid in truth he do. and so supply a fit end to a foolish fiction of old day and thing that might have be. but it must be unpleasant to live in a house whose base be wash by such a tank. 
[ ] crocodile. 
and so back through the chunamed court and among the gentle slop path between the orange tree up to an entrance of the palace guard by two rusty brown dog from kabul each big a a man and each require a man s charpoy to sleep upon. very gay be the front of the palace very brilliant be the glimpse of the damask couch gild room within and very very civilise be the lamp post with ram singh s monogram devise to look like v. r. at the bottom and a coronet at the top. an unseen brass band among the orange bush strike up the overture of the bronze horse. those who know the music will see at once that that be the only tune which exactly and perfectly fit the scene and it surround. it be a coincidence and a revelation. 
in his time and when he be not fight jey singh the second who build the city be a great astronomer a royal omar khayyam for he like the tent maker of nishapur reform a calendar and strive to wring their mystery from the star with instrument worthy of a king. but in the end he write that the goodness of the almighty be above everything and die leave his observatory to decay without the palace ground. 
from the bronze horse to the grass grow enclosure that hold the yantr samrat or prince of dial be rather an abrupt passage. jey singh build him a dial with a gnomon some ninety foot high to throw a shadow against the sun and the gnomon stand to day though there be grass in the kiosque at the top and the flight of step up the hypotenuse be wear. he build also a zodiacal dial twelve dial upon one platform to find the moment of true noon at any time of the year and hollow out of the earth place for two hemispherical cup cut by belt of stone for comparative observation. 
he make cup for calculate eclipse and a mural quadrant and many other strange thing of stone and mortar of which people hardly know the name and but very little of the us. once say a man in charge of two tiny elephant indur and har_ a sahib come with the viceroy and spend eight day in the enclosure of the great neglect observatory see and write thing in a book. but he understand sanskrit the sanskrit upon the face of the dial and the mean of the gnoma and pointer. nowadays no one understand sanskrit not even the pundit. but without doubt jey singh be a great man. 
the hearer echo the statement though he know nothing of astronomy and of all the wonder in the observatory be only strike by the fact that the shadow of the prince of dial move over it vast plate so quickly that it seem a though time wroth at the insolence of jey singh have loose the horse of the sun and be sweep everything dainty palace garden and ruinous instrument into the darkness of eternal night. so he go away chase by the shadow on the dial and return to the hotel where he find men who say this must be a catch word of globe trotter that they be much please at amber. they further think that house rent would be cheap in those part and snigger over the witticism. there be a class of tourist and a strangely large one who individually never get farther than the much please state under any circumstance. this same class of tourist it ha also be observe be usually free with hackneyed pun vapid phrase and allege or bygone joke. jey singh in spite of a few discreditable laches_ be a temperate and tolerant man. but he would have hang those globe trotter in their trunk strap a high a the yantr samrat. 
next morning in the grey dawn the englishman rise up and shake the sand of jeypore from his foot and go with master coryatt and sir thomas roe to adsmir wonder whether a year in jeypore would be sufficient to exhaust it interest and why he have not go out to the tomb of the dead king and the pass of gulta and the fort of motee dungri. but what he wonder at most know how many men who have in any way be connect with the birth of an institution do to the end of their day continue to drag forward and exhume their labour and the honour that do not come to them be the work of the two men who together for year past have be push jeypore along the stone dress path of civilisation peace and comfort. servant of the raj they call themselves and surely they have serve the raj past all praise. the people in the city and the camel driver from the sand hill tell of their work. they themselves hold their peace a to what they have do and when press refer crown baseness to report. print one. 
vi. 
show how her majesty s mail go to udaipur and fell out by the way. 
arrive at ajmir the englishman fell among tent pitch under the shadow of a huge banian tree and in them be a punjabi. now there be no brotherhood like the brotherhood of the pauper province. for it be even great than the genial and unquestioning hospitality which in spite of the loafer and the globe trotter seem to exist throughout india. ajmir be british territory though the inhabitant be allow to carry arm be the headquarter of many of the bank firm who lend to the native state. the complaint of the setts[ ] to day be that their trade be bad because an unsympathetic government induce native state to make railway and become prosperous. look at jodhpur. say a gentleman whose possession might be roughly estimate at anything between thirty and forty five lakh. time be when jodhpur be always in debt and not so long ago either. now they ve get a railroad and be carry salt over it and a sure a i stand here they have a surplus. what can we do. poor pauper. however he make a little profit on the fluctuation in the coinage of the state round him for every small king seem to have the privilege of strike his own image and inflict the great exchange question on his subject. it be a poor state that ha not two seer and five different rupee. 
[ ] native banker. 
from a criminal point of view ajmir be not a pleasant place. the native state lie all round and about it and portion of the district be ten mile off native state lock on every side. thus the criminal who may be a burglarious meena lust for the money bag of the sett or a peshawari down south on a cold weather tour ha his plan of campaign much simplify. 
the englishman make only a short stay in the town hear that there be to be a ceremony tamasha cover a multitude of thing at the capital of his highness the maharana of udaipur a town some hundred and eighty mile south of ajmir not know to many people beyond viceroy and their staff and the official of the rajputana agency. so he take a neemuch train in the very early morning and with the punjabi go due south to chitor the point of departure for udaipur. in time the aravalis give place to a dead flat stone strew plain thick with dhak jungle. late the date palm fraternise with the dhak and low hill stand on either side of the line. to this succeed a tract rich in pure white stone the line be ballast with it. then come more low hill each with a cock s comb of splinter rock overlook dhak jungle and village fence with thorn place that at once declare themselves tigerish. last the huge bulk of chitor show itself on the horizon. the train cross the gumber river and halt almost in the shadow of the hill on which the old pride of udaipur be set. 
it be difficult to give an idea of the chitor fortress. but the long line of brown wall spring out of bush cover hill suggest at once those picture such a the graphic publish of the inflexible or the devastation gigantic men of war with a very low free board plough through green sea. the hill on which the fort stand be ship shape and some mile long and from a distance every inch appear to be scarped and guard. but there be no time to see chitor. the business of the day be to get if possible to udaipur from chitor station which be compose of one platform one telegraph room a bench and several vicious dog. 
the state of udaipur be a backward a jeypore be advance if we judge it by the standard of civilisation. it doe not approve of the incursion of englishman and to do it justice it thoroughly succeed in convey it silent sulkiness. still where there be one english resident one doctor one engineer one settlement officer and one missionary there must be a mail at least once a day. there be a mail. the englishman men say might go by it if he like or he might not. then with a great sink of the heart he begin to realise that his caste be of no value in the stony pasture of mewar among the swagger gentleman who be so lavishly adorn with arm. there be a mail the ghost of a tonga with tattered side cloth and patch roof inconceivably filthy within and without and it be her majesty s. there be another tonga an aram tonga a carriage of ease but the englishman be not to have it. it be reserve for a rajput thakur who be go to udaipur with his tail. the thakur in claret colour velvet with a blue turban a revolver army pattern a sword and five or six friend also with sword come by and indorse the statement. now the mail tonga have a wheel which be destine to become the wheel of fate and to lead to many curious thing. two diseased yellow pony be extract from a dung hill and yoke to the tonga. and after due deliberation her majesty s mail start the thakur follow. 
in twelve hour or thereabouts the seventy mile between chitor and udaipur would be accomplish. behind the tonga canter an arm sowar. he be the guard. the thakur s tonga come up with a rush run deliberately across the bow of the englishman chip a pony and pass on. one life and learn. the thakur seem to object to follow the foreigner. 
at the halt stage once in every six mile that be to say the pony be carefully undress and all their accoutrement fit more or le accurately on to the back of any pony that might happen to be near. the release animal find their way back to their stable alone and unguided. there be no groom and the harness hang on by special dispensation of providence. still the ride over a good road drive through a pitilessly stony country have it charm for a while. at sunset the low hill turn to opal and wine red and the brown dust fly up pure gold. for the tonga be run straight into the sink sun. now and again would pas a traveller on a camel or a gang of bunjarras_[ ] with their pack bullock and their woman. and the sun touch the brass of their sword and gun till the poor wretch seem rich merchant come back from travel with sindbad. 
[ ] gipsy trader. 
on a rock on the right hand side thirty four great vulture be gather over the carcass of a steer. and this be an evil omen. they make unseemly noise a the tonga pass and a raven come out of a bush on the right and answer them. to crown all one of the hide and skin caste sit on the leave hand side of the road cut up some of the flesh that he have steal from the vulture. could a man desire three more inauspicious sign for a night s travel. twilight come and the hill be alive with strange noise a the red moon nearly at her full rise over chitor. to the low hill of the mad geological formation the tumble stratum that seem to obey no law succeed level grind the pasture land of mewar cut by the beruch and wyan stream run over smooth water wear rock and a the heavy embankment and ample waterway show very lively in the rainy season. 
in this region occur the last and most inauspicious omen of all. something have go wrong with a crupper a piece of blue and white punkah cord. the englishman point it out and the driver descend dance on that lonely road an unholy dance sing the while. the dumchi. [ ] the dumchi. the dumchi. in a shrill voice. then he return and drive on while the englishman wonder into what land of lunatic he be head. at an average speed of six mile an hour it be possible to see a great deal of the country. and under brilliant moonlight mewar be desolately beautiful. there be no night traffic on the road no one except the patient sowar his shadow an inky blot on white canter twenty yard behind. once the tonga stray into a company of date tree that fringe the path and once rattle through a little town and once the pony shy at what the driver say be a rock. but it jump up in the moonlight and go away. 
[ ] the crupper. 
then come a great blast heath whereon nothing be more than six inch high a wilderness cover with grass and low thorn. and here a nearly a might be midway between chitor and udaipur the wheel of fate which have be for some time beat against the side of the tonga come off and her majesty s mail two bag include parcel collapse on the wayside. while the englishman repent him that he have neglect the omen of the vulture and the raven the low caste man and the mad driver. 
there be a consultation and an examination of the wheel but the whole tonga be rotten and the axle be smash and the axle pin be bend and nearly red hot. it be nothing say the driver the mail often doe this. what be a wheel. he take a big stone and begin hammer proudly on the tire to show that that at least be sound. a hasty court martial reveal that there be absolutely not one single relief vehicle on the whole road between chitor and udaipur. 
now this wilderness be so utterly waste that not even the bark of a dog or the sound of a night fowl could be hear. luckily the thakur have some twenty mile back step out to smoke by the roadside and his tonga have be pass meanwhile. the sowar be send back to find that tonga and bring it on. he canter into the haze of the moonlight and disappear. then say the driver. have there be no tonga behind u i should have put the mail on a horse because the sirkar s mail cannot stop. the englishman sit down upon the parcel bag for he felt that there be trouble come. the driver look east and west and say. i too will go and see if the tonga can be find for the sirkar s dak cannot stop. meantime oh sahib do you take care of the mail one bag and one bag of parcel. so he run swiftly into the haze of the moonlight and be lose and the englishman be leave alone in charge of her majesty s mail two unhappy pony and a lop side tonga. he light a fire for the night be bitterly cold and only mourn that he could not destroy the whole of the territory of his highness the maharana of udaipur. but he manage to raise a very fine blaze before he reflect that all this trouble be his own fault for wander into native state undesirous of englishman. 
the pony cough dolorously from time to time but they could not lift the weight of a dead silence that seem to be crush the earth. after an interval measurable by century sowar driver and thakur s tonga reappear. the latter full to the brim and bubble over with humanity and bed. we will now say the driver not deign to notice the englishman who have be on guard over the mail put the sirkar s mail into this tonga and go forward. amiable heathen. he be go he say so to leave the englishman to wait in the sahara for certainly thirty hour and perhaps forty eight. tonga be scarce on the udaipur road. there be a few occasion in life when it be justifiable to delay her majesty s mail. this be one of them. seat himself upon the parcel bag the englishman cry in what be intend to be a very terrible voice but the silence soak it up and leave only a thin trickle of sound that any one who touch the bag would be hit with a stick several time over the head. the bag be the only link between him and the civilisation he have so rashly forego. and there be a pause. 
the thakur put his head out of the tonga and speak shrilly in mewari. the englishman reply in english urdu. the thakur withdraw his head and from certain grunt that follow seem to be waken his retainer. then two men fell sleepily out of the tonga and walk into the night. come in say the thakur you and your baggage. my pistol be in that corner. be careful. the englishman take a mail bag in one hand for safety s sake the wilderness inspire an anglo indian cockney with unreasoning fear climb into the tonga which be then load far beyond plimsoll mark and the procession resume it journey. every one in the vehicle it seem a full a the railway carriage that hold alice through the look glass be sahib and hazur. except the englishman. he be simple tum. thou. and a revolver army pattern be print every diamond in the chequer work of it handle on his right hip. when men desire him to move they prod him with the handle of tulwars till they have coil him into an uneasy lump. then they sleep upon him or cannon against him a the tonga bump. it be an aram tonga a tonga for ease. that be the bitter think of all. 
in due season the harness begin to break once every five minute and the driver vow that the wheel would give way also. 
after eight hour in one position it be excessively difficult to walk still more difficult to climb up an unknown road into a dak bungalow. but he who ha seek sleep on an arsenal and under the body of burly rajput can do it. the grey dawn bring udaipur and a french bedstead. a the tonga jingle away the englishman hear the familiar crack of break harness. so he be not the jonah he have be teach to consider himself all through that night of penance. 
a jackal sit in the verandah and howl him to sleep and he dream that he catch a viceroy under the wall of chitor and beat him with a tulwar till he turn into a dak pony whose near foreleg be perpetually come off and who would say nothing but tum when he be ask why he have not build a railway from chitor to udaipur. 
vii. 
touch the child of the sun and their city and the hat mark caste and their merit and a good man s work in the wilderness. 
it be worth a night s discomfort and revolver bed to sleep upon this city of the suryavansi hide among the hill that encompass the great pichola lake. truly the king who govern to day be wise in his determination to have no railroad to his capital. his predecessor be more or le enlighten and have he live a few year long would have bring the iron horse through the dobarri the green gate which be the entrance of the girwa or girdle of hill around udaipur. and with the train would have come the tourist who would have scratch his name upon the temple of garuda and laugh horse laugh upon the lake. let u therefore be thankful that the capital of mewar be hard to reach. 
each man in this land who ha any claim to respectability walk arm carry his tulwar sheathe in his hand or hang by a short sling of cotton pass over the shoulder under his leave armpit. his matchlock or smooth bore if he ha one be bear naked on the shoulder. 
now it be possible to carry any number of lethal weapon without be actually dangerous. an unhandy revolver for instance may be wear for year and at the end accomplish nothing more noteworthy than the murder of it owner. but the rajput s weapon be not mean for display. the englishman catch a camel driver who talk to him in mewari which be a heathenish dialect something like multani to listen to. and the man very gracefully and courteously hand him his sword and matchlock the latter a heavy stump stock arrangement without pretence of sight. the blade be a sharp a a razor and the gun in perfect work order. the coil fuse on the stock be char at the end and the curl ram s horn powder horn open a readily a a much handle whisky flask. unfortunately ignorance of mewari prevent conversation. so the camel driver resume his accoutrement and jog forward on his beast a superb black one with the short curl hubshee hair while the englishman go to the city which be build on hill on the border of the lake. by the way everything in udaipur be build on a hill. there be no level grind in the place except the durbar garden of which more hereafter. because colour hold the eye more than form the first thing noticeable be neither temple nor fort but an ever recur picture paint in the rude form of native art of a man on horseback arm with a lance charge an elephant of war. a a rule the elephant be depict on one side the house door and the rider on the other. there be no representation of an army behind. the figure stand alone upon the whitewash on house and wall and gate again and again and again. a highly intelligent priest grunt that it be a picture. a private of the maharana s regular army suggest that it be an elephant. while a wheat seller his sword at his side be equally certain that it be a raja. beyond that point his knowledge do not go. the explanation of the picture be this. in the day when raja maun of amber put his sword at akbar s service and win for him great kingdom akbar send an army against mewar whose then ruler be pertap singh most famous of all the prince of mewar. selim akbar s son lead the army of the toork. the rajput meet them at the pas of huldighat and fight till one half of their band be slay. once in the press of battle pertap on his great horse chytak come within strike distance of selim s elephant and slew the mahout but selim escape to become jehangir afterwards and the rajput be break. that be three hundred year ago and men have reduce the picture to a sort of diagram that the painter dash in in a few minute without it would seem know what he be commemorate. 
think of these thing the englishman make shift to get to the city and presently come to a tall gate the gate of the sun on which the elephant spike that he have see rot with rust at amber be new and point and effective. the city gate be say to be shut at night and there be a story of a viceroy s guard of honour which arrive before daybreak be compel to crawl ignominiously man by man through a little wicket gate while the horse have to wait without till sunrise. but a civilise yearn for the utmost advantage of octroi and not a fierce fear of robbery and wrong be at the bottom of the continuance of this custom. the wall of the city be loopholed for musketry but there seem to be no mount for gun and the moat without the wall be dry and give cattle pasture. coarse rubble in concrete face with stone make the wall moderately strong. 
internally the city be surprisingly clean though with the exception of the main street pave after the fashion of jullundur of which men say the pavement be put down in the time of alexander and wear by myriad of naked foot into deep barrel and groove. in the case of udaipur the foot of the passenger have wear the rock vein that crop out everywhere smooth and shiny. and in the rain the narrow gully must spout like fire hose. the people have be untouched by cholera for four year proof that providence look after those who do not look after themselves for neemuch cantonment a hundred mile away suffer grievously last summer. and what do you make in udaipur. sword say the man in the shop throw down an armful of tulwars_ kuttars_ and khandas on the stone. do you want any. look here. hereat he take up one of the common sword and flourish it in the sunshine. then he bend it double and a it spring straight begin to make it speak. arm vender in udaipur be a sincere race for they sell to people who really use their ware. the man in the shop be rude distinctly so. his first flush of professional enthusiasm abate he take stock of the englishman and say calmly. what do you want with a sword. then he pick up his good and retreat while certain small boy who deserve a smack laugh riotously from the cop of a little temple hard by. sword seem to be the sole manufacture of the place. at least none of the inhabitant the englishman speak to could think of any other. 
there be a certain amount of personal violence in and about the state or else where would be the good of the weapon. there be occasionally dacoity more or le important. but these be not often hear of and indeed there be no special reason why they should be drag into the light of an unholy publicity for the land govern itself in it own way and be always in it own way which be by no mean ours very happy. the thakurs live each in his own castle on some rock face hill much a they live in the day of tod. though their chance of distinguish themselves except in the school and dispensary line be strictly limit. nominally they pay chutoond_ or a sixth of their revenue to the state and be under feudal obligation to supply their head with so many horseman per thousand rupee. but whether the chutoond justify it name and what be the exact extent of the tail leviable they and perhaps the rajputana agency alone know. they be quiet give no trouble except to the wild boar and personally be magnificent men to look at. the rajput show his breed in his hand and foot which be almost disproportionately small and a well shape a those of a woman. his stirrup and sword handle be even more unusable by western than those elsewhere in india whereas the bhil s knife handle give a large a grip a an english one. now the little bhil be an aborigine which be humiliate to think of. his tongue which may frequently be hear in the city seem to posse some variant of the zulu click which give it a weird and unearthly character. from the main gate of the city the englishman climb uphill towards the palace and the jugdesh temple build by one juggat singh at the begin of the last century. this build must be but ignorance be a bad guide jain in character. from basement to the stone socket of the temple flagstaff it be carve in high relief with elephant men god and monster in frieze of weary profusion. 
the management of the temple have daub a large portion of the build with whitewash for which their revenue should be cut for a year or two. the main shrine hold a large brazen image of garuda and in the corner of the courtyard of the main pile be shrine to mahadeo and the jovial pot belly ganesh. there be no repose in this architecture and the entire effect be one of repulsion. for the cluster figure of man and brute seem always on the point of burst into unclean wriggle life. but it may be that the builder of this form of house desire to put the fear of all their many god into the heart of the worshipper. 
from the temple whose step be wear smooth by the foot of men and whose court be full of the faint smell of stale flower and old incense the englishman go to the palace which crown the high hill overlook the city. here too whitewash have be unsparingly apply but the excuse be that the stately front and the pierce screen be build of a perishable stone which need protection against the weather. one project window in the fa√ßade of the main palace have be treat with minton tile. luckily it be too far up the wall for anything more than the colour to be visible and the pale blue against the pure white be effective. 
a picture of ganesh look out over the main courtyard which be enter by a triple gate and hard by be the place where the king s elephant fight over a low masonry wall. in the side of the hill on which the palace stand be build stable for horse and elephant proof that the architect of old must have understand their business thoroughly. the palace be not a show place and consequently the englishman do not see much of the interior. but he pass through open garden with tank and pavilion very cool and restful till he come suddenly upon the pichola lake and forget altogether about the palace. he find a sheet of steel blue water set in purple and grey hill bind in on one side by marble bunds the fair white wall of the palace and the grey time wear one of the city. and on the other fade away through the white of shallow water and the soft green of weed marsh and rank pasture river field into the land. 
to enjoy open water thoroughly live for a certain number of year bar from anything good than the yearly swell and shrinkage of one of the five river and then come upon two and a half mile of solid restful lake with a cool wind blow off it and little wave spit against the pier of a veritable albeit hideously ugly boat house. on the faith of an exile from the sea you will not stay long among palace be they never so lovely or in little room panel with dutch tile. 
and here follow a digression. there be no life so good a the life of a loafer who travel by rail and road. for all thing and all people be kind to him. from the chill misery of a dak bungalow where they slew one hen with a much parade a the french guillotine pranzini to the well order sumptuousness of the residency be a step bridge over by kindly and unquestioning hospitality. so it happen that the englishman be not only able to go upon the lake in a soft cushion boat with everything handsome about him but might have he choose have kill wild duck with which the lake swarm. 
the mutter of water under a boat s nose be a pleasant thing to hear once more. start at the head of the lake he find himself shut out from sight of the main sheet of water in a loch bound by a sink break bund to steer across which be a matter of some nicety. beyond that lay a second pool span by a narrow arch bridge build men say long before the city of the rise sun which be little more than three hundred year old. the bridge connect the city with brahmapura a white wall enclosure fill with many brahmin and ring with the noise of their conch. beyond the bridge the body of the lake with the city run down to it come into full view. and providence ha arrange for the benefit of such a delight in colour that the rajputni shall wear the most strike tint that she can buy in the bazaar in order that she may beautify the gh√¢ts where she come to bathe. 
the bath ledge at the foot of the city wall be light with woman clothe in raw vermilion dull red indigo and sky blue saffron and pink and turquoise. the water faithfully double everything. but the first impression be of the unreality of the sight for the englishman find himself think of the simla fine art exhibition and the overdaring amateur who have strive to reproduce scene such a these. then a woman rise up and clasp her hand behind her head look at the pass boat and the ripple spread out from her waist in blind white silver far across the water. a a picture a daringly insolent picture it be superb. 
the boat turn aside to shore where huge turtle be lie and a stork have build her a nest big a a haycock in a wither tree and a bevy of coot be flap and gabble in the weed or between great leaf of the victoria regia an escape from the state garden. here be diver and wader kingfisher and snaky neck bird of the cormorant family but no duck. they have see the gun in the boat and be fly to and fro in company across the lake or settle wise thing. in the glare of the sun on the water. the lake be swarm with them but they seem to know exactly how far a twelve bore would carry. perhaps their knowledge have be gain from the englishman at the residency. late a the sun leave the lake and the hill begin to glow like opal the boat make her way to the shallow side of the lake through field of watergrass and dead lotus raffle that rise a high a the bow and cling lovingly about the rudder and part with the noise of silk when it be tear. there she wait for the fall of twilight when the duck would come home to bed and the englishman sprawl upon the cushion in deep content and laziness a he look across to where two marble palace float upon the water and saw all the glory and beauty of the city and wonder whether tod in cock hat and stiff stock have ever come shoot among the reed and if so how in the world he have ever manage to bowl over. 
duck and drake by jove. confide beast weren t they. hi. lalla jump out and get them. it be a brutal thing this double barrel murder perpetrate in the silence of the marsh when the kingly wild duck come back from his wandering with his mate at his side but but the bird be very good to eat. 
if the venetian own the pichola sagar he might say with justice. see it and die. but it be good to live and go to dinner and strike into a new life that of the men who bear the hat mark on their brow a plainly a the well bear native carry the trisul of shiva. 
they be of the same caste a the toiler on the frontier tough bronze men with wrinkle at the corner of the eye get by look across much sun glare. when they would speak of horse they mention arab pony and their talk for the most part drift bombaywards or to abu which be their simla. by these thing the traveller may see that he be far away from the presidency. and will presently learn that he be in a land where the railway be an incident and not an indispensable luxury. folk tell strange story of drive in bullock cart in the rain of breakdown in nullah fifty mile from everywhere and of elephant that use to sink for rest and refreshment half way across swell stream. every place here seem fifty mile from everywhere and the leg of a horse be regard a the only natural mean of locomotion. also and this to the indian cockney who be accustom to the bleach or office man be curious there be to be find many veritable tiger men not story spinner but such a have in their wandering from bikaneer to indore drop their tiger in the way of business. they be enthusiastic over princeling of little know fief lord of austere estate perch on the top of unthrifty hill hard rider and good sportsman. and five six yes fully nine hundred mile to the northward life the sister branch of the same caste the men who swear by pathan biluch and brahui with whom they have shoot or break bread. 
there be a say in upper india that the more desolate the country the great the certainty of find a padre sahib. the proverb seem to hold good in udaipur where the scotch presbyterian mission have a post and others at todgarh to the north and elsewhere. to arrive under providence at the cure of soul through the cure of body certainly seem the rational method of conversion. and this be exactly what the mission be do. their padre in udaipur be also an m. d. and of him a rather strike tale be tell. conceive that the city could bear another hospital in addition to the state one he take furlough go home and there by crusade and preach raise sufficient money for the scheme so that none might say that he be behold to the state. return he build his hospital a very model of neatness and comfort and open the operation book announce his readiness to see any one and every one who be sick. how the call be and be now respond to the dry record of that book will show. and the name of the padre sahib be honour a these ear have hear throughout udaipur and far around. the faith that send a man into the wilderness and the secular energy which enable him to cope with an ever grow demand for medical aid must in time find their reward. if patience and unwearying self sacrifice carry any merit they should do so soon. to day the people be will enough to be heal and the general influence of the padre sahib be very great. but beyond that. still it be impossible to judge aright. 
viii. 
diver passage of speech and action whence the nature art and disposition of the king and his subject may be observe. 
in this land men tell sad story of the death of king not easily find elsewhere. and also speak of sati_ which be generally suppose to be out of date in a manner which make it seem very near and vivid. be please to listen to some of the tale but with all the name cut out because a king ha just a much right to have his family affair respect a ha a british householder pay income tax. 
once upon a time that be to say when the british power be well establish in the land and there be railway be a king who lay die for many day and all include the englishman about him know that his end be certain. but he have choose to lie in an out court or pleasure house of his palace. and with him be some twenty of his favourite wife. the place in which he lay be very near to the city. and there be a fear that his womankind should on his death go mad with grief cast off their veil and run out into the street uncover before all men. in which case nothing not even the power of the press and the locomotive and the telegraph and cheap education and enlighten municipal council could have save them from the burn pyre for they be the wife of a king. so the political do his best to induce the die man to go to the fort of the city a safe place close to the regular zenana where all the woman could be keep within wall. he say that the air be good in the fort but the king refuse. and that he would recover in the fort. but the king refuse. after some day the latter turn and say. _why be you so keen sahib upon get my old bone up to the fort. drive to his last defence the political say simply. well maharana sahib the place be close to the road you see and. the king saw and say. oh that s it. i ve be puzzle my brain for four day to find out what on earth you be drive at. i ll go to night. but there may be some difficulty begin the political. you think so say the king. if i only hold up my little finger the woman will obey me. go now and come back in five minute and all will be ready for departure. a a matter of fact the political withdraw for the space of fifteen minute and give order that the conveyance which he have keep in readiness day and night should be get ready. in fifteen minute those twenty woman with their handmaiden be pack and ready for departure. and the king die late at the fort and nothing happen. here the englishman ask why a frantic woman must of necessity become a sati_ and felt properly abash when he be tell that she must. there be nothing else for her if she go out unveil. 
the rush out force the matter. and indeed if you consider the matter from the rajput point of view it doe. 
then follow a very grim tale of the death of another king. of the long vigil by his bedside before he be take off the bed to die upon the grind. of the shut of a certain mysterious door behind the bed head which shut be follow by a rustle of woman s dress. of a walk on the top of the palace to escape the heat air of the sick room. and then in the grey dawn the wail upon wail break from the zenana a the news of the king s death go in. i never wish to hear anything more horrible and awful in my life. you could see nothing. you could only hear the poor wretch say the political with a shiver. 
the last rest place of the maharanas of udaipur be at ahar a little village two mile east of the city. here they go down in their robe of state their horse follow behind and here the political saw after the death of a maharana the dance girl dance before the poor white ash the musician play among the cenotaph and the golden hookah sword and water vessel lay out for the naked soul doom to hover twelve day round the funeral pyre before it could depart on it journey toward a fresh birth. once in a neighbour state it be say one of the dance girl steal a march in the next world s precedence and her lord s affection upon the legitimate queen. the affair happen by the way after the mutiny and be accomplish with great pomp in the light of day. subsequently those who might have stop it but do not be severely punish. the girl say that she have no one to look to but the dead man and follow him to use tod s formula through the flame. it would be curious to know whether sati be altogether abolish among these lonely hill in the wall hold of the thakurs. 
but to return from the burn grind to modern udaipur a at present work under the maharana and his prime minister rae punna lal c. i. e. to begin with his highness be a racial anomaly in that judge by the strict european standard he be a man of temperate life the husband of one wife whom he marry before he be choose to the throne after the death of the maharana sujjun singh in. sujjun singh die childless and give no hint of his desire a to succession and omit all the genealogical and political reason which would drive a man mad futteh singh be choose by the thakurs from the seorati branch of the family which sangram singh ii. found. he be thus a young son of a young branch of a young family which lucid statement should suffice to explain everything. the man who could deliberately unravel the succession of any one of the rajput state would be perfectly capable of explain the politics of all the frontier tribe from jumrood to quetta. 
roughly speak the maharana and the prime minister in whose family the office ha be hereditary for many generation divide the power of the state. they control more or le the mahand raj sabha or council of direction and revision. this be compose of many of the rawats and thakurs of the state and the poet laureate who under a le genial administration would be presumably the registrar. there be also district officer officer of custom superintendent of the mint master of the horse and supervisor of dole which last be pretty and touch. the state officer itself and the englishman s investigation fail to unearth any bengali. the commandant of the state army about five thousand men of all arm be a retire non commission officer a mr. lonergan. who a the medal on his breast attest ha do the state some service and now in his old age rejoice in the local rank of major general and teach the maharaja s gun to make uncommonly good practice. the infantry be smart and well set up while the cavalry rare thing in native state have a distinct notion of keep their accoutrement clean. they be further well mount on light wiry mewar and kathiawar horse. incidentally it may be mention that the pathan come down with his picking from the punjab to udaipur and find a market there for animal that be much good employ in our service but the complaint be a stale one. let u see late on what the jodhpur stable hold. and then formulate an indictment against the government. so much for the indigenous administration of udaipur. the one drawback in the present maharaja from the official point of view be his want of education. he be a thoroughly good man but be not bring up with the kingship before his eye consequently he be not an english speak man. 
there be a story tell of him which be worth the repeat. an englishman who flatter himself that he could speak the vernacular fairly well pay him a visit and discourse with a round mouth. the maharana hear him politely and turn to a satellite demand a translation. which be give. then say the maharana. speak to him in angrezi. the angrezi speak by the interpreter be urdu a the sahib speak it and the englishman have end his conference depart abash. but this backwardness be eminently suit to a place like udaipur and a european prince be not always a desirable thing. the curious and even startle simplicity of his life be worth preserve. here be a specimen of one of his day. rise at four and the dawn can be bitterly chill he bathe and pray after the custom of his race and at six be ready to take in hand the first instalment of the day s work which come before him through his prime minister and occupy him for three or four hour till the first meal of the day be ready. at two o clock he attend the mahand raj sabha and work till five retire at a healthily primitive hour. he be say to have his hand fairly firmly upon the rein of rule and to know a much a most monarch know of the way in which his revenue some thirty lakh be dispose of. the prime minister s career ha be a chequer and interest one include a dismissal from power. this be work by the queen from behind the screen. an arrest and an attack with sword which all but end in his murder. he ha not so much power a his predecessor have for the reason that the present maharaja allow little but tiger shoot to distract him from the supervision of the state. his highness by the way be a first class shoot and ha bag eighteen tiger already. he preserve his game carefully and permission to kill tiger be not readily obtainable. 
a curious instance of the old order give place to the new be in process of evolution and deserve notice. the prime minister s son futteh lal a boy of twenty year old ha be educate at the mayo college ajmir and speak and write english. there be few native official in the state who do this. and the consequence be that the lad ha win a very fair insight into state affair and know generally what be go forward both in the eastern and western sphere of the little court. in time he may qualify for direct administrative power and udaipur will be add to the list of the state that be govern english fashion. what the end will be after three generation of prince and dewans have be put through the mill of the rajkumar college those who live will learn. 
more interest be the question for how long can the vitality of a people whose life be arm be suspend. men in the north say that by the favour of the government which bring peace the sikh sirdar be rot on their land. and the rajput thakurs say of themselves that they be grow rusty. the old old problem force itself on the most unreflective mind at every turn in the gay street of udaipur. a frenchman might write. behold there the horse of the rajput foam pant caracole but always fetter with his head so majestic upon his bosom so amply fill with a generous heart. he rage but he doe not advance. see there the destiny of the rajput who bestride him and upon whose leave flank bound the sabre useless the haberdashery of the ironmonger only. pity the horse in reason for that life there be his raison d √™tre. pity ten thousand time more the rajput for he ha no raison d √™tre. he be an anachronism in a blue turban. 
the gaul might be wrong but tod write thing which seem to support this view in the day when he wish to make buff state of the land he love so well. 
let u visit the durbar garden where little naked cupid be trample upon fountain of fat fish all in bronze where there be cypress and red path and a deer park full of all variety of deer besides two growl fluffy little panther cub a black panther who be the prince of darkness and a gentleman and a terrace full of tiger bear and guzerat lion bring from the king of oudh s sale. 
ix. 
of the pig drive which be a panther kill and of the departure to chitor. 
above the durbar garden lie low hill in which the maharana keep very strictly guard his pig and his deer and anything else that may find shelter in the low scrub or under the scatter boulder. these preserve be scientifically parcel out with high red stone wall. and here and there be dot tiny shoot stand masonry sentry box in which five or six men may sit at ease and shoot. it have be arrange to entertain the englishman who be gather at the residency to witness the investiture of the king with the g. c. s. i. that there should be a little pig drive in front of the kala odey or black shoot box. the rajput be a man and a brother in respect that he will ride shoot eat pig and drink strong water like an englishman. of the pig hunt he make almost a religious duty and of the wine drink no le. read how desperately they use to ride in udaipur at the begin of the century when tod always in his cock hat to be sure count up the tale of accident at the end of the day s sport. 
there be something unfair in shoot pig. but each man who go out console himself with the think that it be utterly impossible to ride the brute up the almost perpendicular hillside or down rocky ravine and that he individually would only go just for the fun of the thing. those who stay behind make rude remark on the subject of pork butcher and the danger that attend shoot from a balcony. there be way and way of slay pig from the orthodox method which begin with _the boar the boar the mighty boar. overnight and end with a shaky bridle hand next morn to the sober and solitary pot shoot at dawn from a railway embankment run through river marsh. but the perfect way be this. get a large four horse break and drive till you meet an unlimited quantity of pad elephant wait at the foot of rich hill preserve. mount slowly and with dignity and go in swing procession by the marble face border of one of the most lovely lake on earth. strike off on a semi road semi hill torrent path through unthrifty thorny jungle and so climb up and up and up till you see spread like a map below the lake and the palace and the city hem in by the sea of hill that lie between udaipur and mount abu a hundred mile away. then take your seat in a comfortable chair in a fine two storied grand stand with an awning spread atop to keep off the sun while the rawat of amet and the prime minister s heir no le invite you to take your choice of the many rifle spread on a ledge at the front of the build. this gentleman who screw your pet pony at early dawn after the sound that vanish into cover soon a sight or painfully follow the tiger through the burn heat of mewar in may this be shoot after the fashion of ouida in musk and ambergris and patchouli. 
it be demoralise. one of the best and hard rider of the lahore tent club in the old day a the boar of bouli lena singh know well say openly. this be a first class scheme and fell to test his trigger a though he have be a pot hunter from his birth. derision and threat of exposure move him not. give me an arm chair. say he. this be the proper way to deal with pig. and he put up his foot on the ledge and stretch himself. 
there be many weapon to choose from the double barrel express whose bullet be a tear rend shell to the rawat of amet s regulation military martini henri. a profane public at the residency have suggest club and saw a amply sufficient for the work in hand. here they be move by envy which passion be ten fold increase when but this come late on. the beat be along a deep gorge in the hill flank on either crest by stone wall man with beater. immediately opposite the shoot box the wall on the upper or high hill make a sharp turn downhill contract the space through which the pig would have to pas to a gut which be variously say to be from one hundred and fifty to four hundred yard across. most of the shoot be up or down hill. 
a philanthropic desire not to murder more bhils than be absolutely necessary to maintain a healthy current of human life in the hilly tract couple with a well found dread of the hind or horse end of a double barrel express which would be sure to go off both barrel together lead the englishman to take a gunless seat in the background. then a silence fell upon the party and very far away up the gorge the heat afternoon air be cut by the shrill tremolo squeal of the bhil beater. now a man may be in no sort or fashion a shikari may hold buddhistic objection to the slaughter of live thing but there be something in the extraordinary noise of an agitate bhil which make even the most peaceful mortal get up and yearn like tartarin of tarescon for lion always at a safe distance be it understand. a the beat draw near under the squeal the _ul al lu lu lu_ be hear a long draw bittern like boom of _so oor. _so oor. pig. pig. and the crash of boulder. the gun rise in their place forget that each and all have merely come to see the fun and begin to fumble among the little mound of cartridge under the chair. presently trip delicately over the rock a pig step out of a cactus bush and the fusillade begin. the dust fly and the branch chip but the pig go on a blue grey shadow almost undistinguishable against the rock and take no harm. sight shot say the gun sulkily. the beat come near and then the listener discover what the bubble scream be like. for he forget straightway about the beat and go back to the dusk of an easter monday in the garden of the crystal palace before the bombardment of kars set piece ten thousand foot square have be illuminate and about five hundred arries be tickle a thousand arriets. their giggle and nothing else be the noise of the bhil. so curiously doe sydenham and western rajputana meet. then come another pig who be smite to the death and roll down among the bush draw his last breath in a human and horrible manner. 
but full on the crest of the hill blow along there be no other word to describe it like a ball of thistle down pass a brown shadow and men cry. _bagheera_ or panther. accord to their nationality and blaze. the shadow leap the wall that have turn the pig downhill and vanish among the cactus. never mind say the prime minister s son consolingly we ll beat the other side of the hill afterwards and get him yet. oh he s a mile off by this time say the gun. but the rawat of amet a magnificent young man smile a sweet smile and say nothing. more pig pass and be slay and many more break back through the beater who presently come through the cover in score. they be in russet green and red uniform each man bear a long spear and the hillside be turn on the instant to a camp of robin hood s forester. then they bring up the dead from behind bush and under rock among others a twenty seven inch brute who bore on his flank. all pig shoot in a beat be ex officio boar. a hideous half heal scar big a a man s hand of a bullet wind. express bullet be ghastly thing in their effect for a the shikari be never tire of demonstrate they knock the inside of animal into pulp. 
the second beat of the reverse side of the hill have barely begin when the panther return uneasily a if something be keep her back much low down the hill. then the face of the rawat of amet change a he bring his gun up to his shoulder. look at him a he fire one forget all about the mayo college at which he have be educate and remember only some trivial and out of date affair in which his forefather have be concern when a bridegroom with his bride at his side charge down the slope of the chitor road and die among akbar s men. there be story connect with the house of amet which be tell in mewar to day. the young man s face for a short a time a it take to pull trigger and see where the bullet fall be a white light upon all these tale. 
then the mask shut down a he click out the cartridge and very sweetly give it a his opinion that some other gun not his own have bag the panther who lay shoot through the spine feebly try to drag herself downhill into cover. it be an awful thing to see a big beast die when the soul be wrench out of the struggle body in ten second. wild horse shall not make the englishman disclose the exact number of shot that be fire. it be enough to say that four englishman now scatter to the four wind of heaven be each morally certain that he and he alone shoot that panther. in time when distance and the mirage of the sand of uodhpur shall have soften the harsh outline of truth the englishman who do not fire a shoot will come to believe that he be the real slayer and will carefully elaborate that lie. 
a few minute after the murder a two year old cub come trot along the hillside and be bowl over by a very pretty shoot behind the leave ear and through the palate. then the beater lance show through the bush and the gun begin to realise that they have allow to escape or have drive back by their fire a multitude of pig. 
this end the beat and the procession return to the residency to heap dead panther upon those who have call them pork butcher and to stir up the lake of envy with the torpedo of brilliant description. the englishman s attempt to compare the fusillade which greet the panther to the continuous drum of a ten barrel nordenfeldt be however coldly receive. thus harshly be truth treat all the world over. 
and then after a little time come the end and a return to the road in search of new country. but shortly before the departure the padre sahib who know every one in udaipur read a sermon in a sentence. the maharana s investiture which ha already be describe in the indian paper have take place and the carriage duly escort by the erinpura horse be return to the residency. in a niche of waste land under the shadow of the main gate a place strew with rubbish and shard of pottery a dilapidate old man be try to control his horse and a hookah on the saddle bow. the blunder garron have be make restive by the rush past and the hookah all but fell from the hamper hand. see that man say the padre tersely. that s singh. he intrigue for the throne not so very long ago. it be a pitiful little picture and need no further comment. 
for the benefit of the loafer it should be note that udaipur will never be pleasant or accessible until the present mail contractor have be hang. they be extortionate and untruthful and their one set of harness and one tonga be a rotten a pear. however the weariness of the flesh must be great indeed to make the wanderer blind to the beauty of a journey by clear starlight and in bite cold to chitor. about six mile from udaipur the granite hill close in upon the road and the air grow warm until with a rush and a rattle the tonga swing through the great dobarra the gate in the double circle of hill round udaipur on to the pasture of mewar. more than once the girwa ha be a death trap to those who rashly enter it. and an army ha be cut up on the border of the pichola lake. even now the genius of the place be strong upon the hill and a he felt the cold air from the open grind without the barrier the englishman find himself repeat the word of one of the hat mark tribe whose destiny keep him within the dobarra. you must have a hobby of some kind in these part or you ll die. very lovely be udaipur and thrice pleasant be a few day spend within her gate but. read what tod say who stay two year behind the dobarra and accept the desert of marwar a a delightful change. 
it be good to be free a wanderer upon the highway know not what to morrow will bring forth whether the wall in nicety of an english household rich in all that make life fair and desirable or a sleepless night in the society of a good cum book office cum parcel clerk on fifteen rupee a month who tell in stilted english the story of his official life while the telegraph gibber like a maniac once in an hour and then be dumb and the pariah dog fight and howl over the cotton bale on the platform. 
verily there be no life like life on the road when the sky be cool and all men be kind. 
x. 
a little of the history of chitor and the malpractice of a she elephant. 
there be a certain want of taste an almost actual indecency in see the sun rise on the earth. until the heat haze begin and the distance thicken nature be so very naked that the act√¶on who ha surprise her dress blush. sunrise on the plain of mewar be an especially brutal affair. 
the moon be burn out and the air be bitterly cold when the englishman head due east in his tonga and the patient sowar behind nod and yawn in the saddle. there be no warn of the day s advent. the horse be unharness at one halt stage in the thick soft shadow of night and ere their successor have limp under the bar a raw and cruel light be upon all thing so that the englishman could see every rent seam in the rock around. a little further and he come upon the black bulk of chitor between him and the morning sun. it ha already be say that the fort resemble a man of war. every distant view heighten this impression for the swell of the side follow the form of a ship and the bastion on the south wall make the sponsons in which the machine gun be mount. from bow to stern the thing more than three mile long be between three and five hundred foot high and from one half to one quarter of a mile broad. have patience now to listen to a rough history of chitor. 
in the begin no one know clearly who scrap the hillside of the hill rise out of the bare plain and make of it a place of strength. it be write that eleven and a half century ago bappa rawul the demi god whose stature be twenty cubit whose loin cloth be five hundred foot long and whose spear be beyond the power of mortal man to lift take chitor from man singh the mori prince and write the first chapter of the history of mewar which he receive ready make from man singh who if the chronicle speak sooth be his uncle. many and very marvellous legend cluster round the name of bappa rawul. and he be say to have end his day far away from india in khorasan where he marry an unlimited number of the daughter of heth and be the father of all the nowshera pathan. some who have wander by the sign post of inscription into the fog of old time aver that two century before bappa rawul take chitor the mori division of the pramar rajput who be the rule family of mewar have find a hold in bhilwara and for four century before that time have rule in kathiawar. and have royally sack and slay and be sack and slay in turn. but these thing be for the curious and the scholar and not for the reader who read lightly. nine prince succeed bappa between and a. d. and among these be one alluji who build a jain tower upon the brow of the hill for in those day though the sun be worship men be all jains. 
and here they live and sallied into the plain and fight and increase the border of their kingdom or be suddenly and stealthily murder or stand shoulder to shoulder against the incursion of the devil men from the north. in a. d. be bear samar singh and he marry into the family of prithi raj the last hindu emperor of delhi who be at feud in regard to a succession question with the prince of kanauj. in the war that follow kanauj be hard press by prithi raj and samar singh call shahabuddin ghori to his aid. at first samar singh and prithi raj break the army of the northern somewhere in the low punjab but two year late shahabuddin come again and after three day fight on the bank of the kaggar slew samar singh capture and murder prithi raj and sack delhi and amber while samar singh s favourite queen become sati at chitor. but another wife a princess of patun keep her life and when shahabuddin send down kutbuddin to waste her land lead the rajput army in person from chitor and defeat kutbuddin. 
then follow confusion through eleven turbulent reign that the annalist ha fail to unravel. once in the year between and the open of the fourteenth century chitor must have be take by the mussulman for it be write that one prince recover chitor and make the name of rana to be recognise by all. six prince be slay in battle against the mussulman in vain attempt to clear the land from the presence of the infidel. 
then ala ud din khilji the pathan emperor sweep the country to the dekkan. in those day and these thing be confusedly set down a have happen at the end of the thirteenth century a relative of rana lakhsman singh the then rana of chitor have marry a rajput princess of ceylon pudmini and she be fair of all flesh on earth. her fame be sing through the land by the poet and she become in some sort the helen of chitor. ala ud din hear of her beauty and promptly besiege the fort. when he find his enterprise too difficult he pray that he might be permit to see pudmini s face in a mirror and this wish so say the tale be grant. know that the rajput be a gentleman he enter chitor almost unarm saw the face in the mirror and be well treat. the husband of the fair pudmini accompany him in return to the camp at the foot of the hill. like raja runjeet in the ballad the rajput he. 
trust a mussulman s word wah. wah. trust a liar to lie. out of his eyrie they tempt my bird fetter his wing that he could not fly. 
pudmini s husband be catch by a trick and ala ud din demand pudmini a the price of his return. the rajput here show that they too could scheme and send in great state pudmini s litter to the besieger intrenchment. but there be no pudmini in the litter and her follow of handmaiden be a band of seven hundred arm men. thus in the confusion of a camp fight pudmini s husband be rescue and ala ud din s soldiery follow hard on his heel to the gate of chitor where the best and brave on the rock be kill before ala ud din withdraw only to return soon after and with a double army besiege in earnest. his first attack men call the half sack of chitor for though he fail to win within the wall he kill the flower of the rajput. the second attack end in the first sack and the awful sati of the woman on the rock. 
when everything be hopeless and the very terrible goddess who life in the bowel of chitor have speak and claim for death eleven out of the twelve of the rana s son all who be young or fair woman betook themselves to a great underground chamber and the fire be light and the entrance be wall up and they die. the rajput open the gate and fight till they could fight no more and ala ud din the victorious enter a waste and desolate city. he wreck everything except only the palace of pudmini and the old jain tower before mention. that be all he could do for there be few men alive of the defender of chitor when the day be win and the woman be ash underground. 
ajai singh the one survive son of lakshman singh have at his father s insistence escape from chitor to carry on the line when good day should come. he bring up hamir son of one of his elder brother to be a thorn in the side of the invader and hamir overthrow maldeo chief of jhalore and vassal of ala ud din into whose hand ala ud din have not too generously give what be leave of chitor. so the sesodias come to their own again and the successor of hamir extend their kingdom and rebuild chitor a king know how to rebuild city in a land where human labour and life be cheap than bread and water. for two century saith tod mewar flourish exceedingly and be the paramount kingdom of all rajasthan. great of all the successor of hamir be kumbha rana who when the ghilzai dynasty be rot away and viceroy declare themselves king meet defeat take captive and release without ransom mahmoud of malwa. kumbha rana build a tower of victory nine story high to commemorate this and the other success of his reign and the tower stand to day a mark for mile across the plain. 
but the well establish kingdom weaken and the ruler take favourite and disgust their best supporter after the immemorial custom of too prosperous ruler. also they murder one another. in a. d. bahadur shah king of gujarat see the decay and remember how one of his predecessor together with mahmoud of malwa have be humble by mewar in year go by set out to take his revenge of time and mewar then rule by rana bikrmajit who have make a new capital at deola. bikrmajit do not stay to give battle in that place. his chief be out of hand and chitor be the heart and brain of mewar. so he march thither and the god be against him. bahadur shah mine one of the chitor bastion and wipe out in the explosion the hara prince of boondee with five hundred follower. jowahir bae bikrmajit s mother head a sally from the wall and be slay. there be frank gunner among bahadur shah s force and they hasten the end. the rajput make a second johur_ a sacrifice great than the sacrifice of pudmini. and thirteen thousand be blow up in the magazine or stab or poison before the gate be open and the defender rush down. 
out of the carnage be save udai singh a babe of the blood royal who grow up to be a coward and a shame to his line. the story of his preservation be write large in tod and edwin arnold sing it. read it who be interest. but when udai singh come to the throne of chitor through blood and misrule after bahadur shah have withdraw from the wreck of the fort akbar sit on the throne of delhi and it be write that few people should withstand the guardian of mankind. moreover udai singh be the slave of a woman. it be akbar s destiny to subdue the rajput and to win many of them to his own service. send a rajput prince of amber to get him far away arrakan. akbar march against chitor once and be repulse. the woman who rule udai singh head a charge against the besieger because of the love she bore to her lover. something of this sort have happen in ala ud din s time and like ala ud din akbar return and sit down in a huge camp before chitor in a. d. udai singh flee what be come. and because the goddess of chitor demand always that a crown head must fall if the defence of her home be to be successful chitor fell a it have fall before in a johur of thousand a last rush of the men and the entry of the conqueror into a reek ruin slaughter pen. akbar s sack be the most terrible of the three for he kill everything that have life upon the rock and wreck and overturn and spoil. the wonder the last wonder be that he do not destroy kumbha rana s tower of victory the memorial of the defeat of a mahometan prince. with the third sack the glory of chitor depart and udai singh found himself a new capital the city of udaipur. though chitor be recover in jehangir s time by udai singh s grandson it be never again make the capital of mewar. it stand and rot where it stand till enlighten and loyal feudatory in the present year of grace make attempt with the help of executive engineer to sweep it up and keep it in repair. the above be roughly very roughly indeed the tale of the sack of chitor. 
follow an interlude for the study even of inaccurate history be indigestible to many. there be an elephant at chitor to take bird of passage up the hill and she she be fifty one year old and her name be gerowlia come to the dak bungalow for the englishman. let not the word dak bungalow deceive any man into believe that there be even moderate comfort at chitor. gerowlia wait in the sunshine and chuckle to herself like a female pauper when she receive snuff. her mahout say that he would go away for a drink of water. so he walk and walk and walk till he disappear on the stone strew plain and the englishman be leave alone with gerowlia age fifty one. she have be tie by the chain on her near hind leg to a pillar of the verandah. but the string be coir and more an emblem of authority than a mean of restraint. when she have thoroughly exhaust all the resource of the country within range of her trunk she eat up the string and begin to investigate the verandah. there be more coir string and she eat it all while the carpenter who be repair the dak bungalow curse her and her ancestry from afar. about this time the englishman be rouse to a knowledge of the business for gerowlia have exhaust the string try to come into the verandah. she have most unwisely be pamper with biscuit an hour before. the carpenter stand on an outcrop of rock and say angrily. see what damage your hathi ha do sahib. tisn t my hathi_ say the sahib plaintively. you order it quoth he and it ha be here ever so long eat up everything. he throw piece of stone at gerowlia and go away. it be a terrible thing to be leave alone with an unshackled elephant even though she be a venerable spinster. gerowlia move round the dak bungalow blow her nose in a nervous and undecided manner and presently find some more string and thatch which she eat. this be too much. the englishman go out and speak to her. she open her mouth and salaam. mean thereby biscuit. so long a she remain in this position she could do no harm. 
imagine a boundless rock strew plain break here and there by low hill dominate by the rock of chitor and bisect by a single metre gauge railway track run into the infinite and unrelieved by even a way inspector s trolly. in the foreground put a brand new dak bungalow furnish with a french bedstead and nothing else. in the verandah place an embarrass englishman smile into the open mouth of an idiotic female elephant. but gerowlia could not live on smile alone. find that no food be forthcoming she shut her mouth and renew her attempt to get into the verandah and eat more thatch. to say hi. to an elephant be a misdirect courtesy. it quicken the pace and if you flick her on the trunk with a wet towel she curl the trunk out of harm s way. special education be necessary. a little breechless boy pass carry a lump of stone. hit her on the foot sahib say he. hit her on the foot. gerowlia have by this time nearly scrap off her pad and there be no sign of the mahout. the englishman go out and find a tent peg and return in the extremity of his wrath smite her bitterly on the nail of the near forefoot. 
gerowlia hold up her foot to be beat and make the most absurd noise squawk in fact exactly like an old lady who ha narrowly escape be run over. she back out of the verandah still squawk on three foot and in the open hold up near and off forefoot alternately to be beat. it be very pitiful for one swing of her trunk could have knock the englishman flat. he cease whack her but she squawk for some minute and then fell placidly asleep in the sunshine. when the mahout return he beat her for break her tether exactly a the englishman have do but much more severely and the ridiculous old thing hop on three leg for fully five minute. come along sahib say the mahout. i will show this mother of bastard who be the driver. fat daughter of the devil sit down. you would eat thatch would you. how doe the iron taste. and he give gerowlia a headache which affect her temper all through the afternoon. she set off across the railway line which run below the rock of chitor into break grind cut up with nullah and cover with low scrub over which it would have be difficult to have take a sure foot horse so fragmentary and disconnect be it nature. 
xi. 
prof conclusively the existence of the dark tower visit by childe rolande and of bogey who frighten child. 
the gamberi river clear a a trout stream run through the waste round chitor and be span by an old bridge very solid and massive say to have be build before the sack of ala ud din. the bridge be in the middle of the stream the flood have race round either end of it and be reach by a steeply slop stone causeway. from the bridge to the new town of chitor which lie at the foot of the hill run a straight and well keep road flank on either side by the scatter remnant of old house and here and there fall temple. the road like the bridge be no new thing and be wide enough for twenty horseman to ride abreast. 
new chitor be a very dirty and apparently thrive little town full of grain merchant and seller of arm. the way be barely wide enough for the elephant of dignity and the little brown baby of impudence. the englishman go through always on a slope painfully accentuate by gerowlia who with all possible respect to her year must have be a baggage animal and no true sahib s mount. let the local baedeker speak for a moment. the ascent to chitor which begin from within the southeast angle of the town be nearly a mile to the upper gate with a slope of about in. there be two zig zag bend and on the three portion thus form be seven gate of which one however ha only the basement leave. this be the language of fact which very properly leaf out of all account the genius of the place who sit at the gate near the new city and be with the sightseer throughout. the first impression of repulsion and awe be give by a fragment of tumble sculpture close to a red daub lingam_ near the padal pol or low gate. it be a piece of frieze and the figure of the men be wear nearly smooth by time. what be visible be finely and frankly obscene to an english mind. 
the road be protect on the cliff side by a thick stone wall loopholed for musketry one aperture to every two foot between fifteen and twenty foot high. this wall be be repair throughout it length by the maharana of udaipur. on the hillside among the boulder loose stone and dhak scrub lip stone wreckage that must have come down from the brown bastion above. 
a gerowlia labour up the stone shoe slope the englishman wonder how much life have flow down this sluice of battle and be lose at the padal pol the last and low gate where in the old day the besiege army put their best and brave battalion. once at the head of the low slope there be a clear run down of a thousand yard with no chance of turn aside either to the right or leave. even a he wonder he be bring abreast of two stone chhatris each carry a red daub stone. they be the graf of two very brave men jeemal of bedmore and kalla who fell in akbar s sack fight like rajput. read the story of their death and learn what manner of warrior they be. their graf be all that speak openly of the hundred of struggle on the low slope where the fight be always fierce. 
at last after half an hour s climb the main gate the ram pol be gain and the englishman pass into the city of chitor and then and there form a resolution since break not to write one word about it for fear that he should be set down a a babble and a gush enthusiast. object of arch√¶ological interest be duly describe in an admirable little book of chitor which after one look the englishman abandon. one cannot do chitor with a guide book. the chaplain of the english mission to jehangir say the best that be to be say when he describe the place three hundred year ago write quaintly. chitor an ancient great kingdom the chief city so call which standeth on a mighty high hill flat on the top wall about at the least ten english mile. there appear to this day above a hundred church ruin and diver fair palace which be lodge in like manner among their ruin a many englishman by the observation have guess. it chief inhabitant to day be zum and ohim bird and wild beast but the stately ruin thereof give a shadow of it beauty while it flourish in it pride. gerowlia strike into a narrow pathway force herself through garden tree and disturb the peacock. an evil guide man on the grind wave his hand and begin to speak. but be silence. the death of amber be a nothing to the death of chitor a body whence the life have be drive by riot and the sword. men have parcel the garden of her palace and the courtyard of her temple into field. and cattle graze among the remnant of the shatter tomb. but over all over rent and bastion split temple wall pierce roof and prone pillar lay the shadow of it beauty while it flourish in it pride. the englishman walk into a stately palace of many room where the sunlight stream in through wall and roof and up crazy stone stairway hold together it seem by the maraud tree. in one bastion a wind sow peepul have wrench a thick slab clear of the wall but hold it tight press in a crook of a branch a a man hold down a fall enemy under his elbow shoulder and forearm. in another place a strange uncanny wind spring from nowhere be sing all alone among the pillar of what may have be a hall of audience. the englishman wander so far in one palace that he come to an almost black dark room high up in a wall and say proudly to himself. i must be the first man who ha be here. mean no harm or insult to any one. but he trip and fell and a he put out his hand he felt that the stair have be wear hollow and smooth by the thread of innumerable naked foot. then he be afraid and come away very quickly step delicately over fall frieze and bit of sculpture men so a not to offend the dead. and be mightily relieve when he recover his elephant and allow the guide to take him to kumbha rana s tower of victory. 
this stand like all thing in chitor among ruin but time and the other enemy have be good to it. it be a jain edifice nine storey high crown atop be this design insult or undesigned repair. with a purely mahometan dome where the pigeon and the bat live. except this blemish the tower of victory be nearly a fair a when it leave the hand of the builder whose name ha not be hand down to u. it be to be observe here that the first or more ruin tower of victory build in alluji s day when chitor be comparatively young be raise by some pious jain a proof of conquest over thing spiritual. the second tower be more worldly in intent. 
those who care to look may find elsewhere a definition of it architecture and it more strike peculiarity. it be in kind but not in degree like the jugdesh temple at udaipur and a it exceed it in magnificence so it effect upon the mind be more intense. the confuse intricacy of the figure with which it be wreathe from top to bottom the recurrence of the one calm face the god enthrone hold the wheel of the law and the appal lavishness of decoration all work toward the instilment of fear and aversion. 
surely this must have be one of the object of the architect. the tower in the arrangement of it stairway be like the interior of a chinese carve ivory puzzle ball. the idea give be that even while you be ascend you be wrap yourself deep and deep in the tangle of a mighty maze. add to this the half light the throng army of sculpture figure the mad profusion of design splash a impartially upon the underside of the stone window slab a upon the door beam of the threshold add most abhorrent of all the slippery sliminess of the wall always wear smooth by naked men and you will understand that the tower be not a soothe place to visit. the englishman fancy presumptuously that he have in a way grasp the builder s idea. and when he come to the top storey and sit among the pigeon his theory be this. to attain power write the builder of old in sentence of fine stone it be necessary to pas through all sort of close pack horror treachery battle and insult in darkness and without knowledge whether the road lead upward or into a hopeless cul de sac. kumbha rana must many time have climb to the top storey and look out toward the upland of malwa on the one side and his own great mewar on the other in the day when all the rock hum with life and the clatter of hoof upon the stony way and mahmoud of malwa be safe in hold. how he must have swell with pride fine insolent pride of life and rule and power power not only to break thing but to compel such builder a those who pile the tower to his royal will. there be no decoration in the top storey to bewilder or amaze nothing but well groove stone slab and a boundless view fit for king who trace their ancestry. 
from time when forth from the sunlight the first of our king come down and have the earth for his footstool and wear the star for his crown. 
the builder have leave no mark behind him not even a mark on the threshold of the door or a sign in the head of the topmost step. the englishman look in both place believe that those be the place generally choose for mark cut. so he sit and meditate on the beauty of kingship and the unholiness of hindu art and what power a shadowland of lewd monstrosity have upon those who believe in it and what lord dufferin who be the near approach to a king in this india must have think when aide de camp clank after him up the narrow step. but the day be wear and he come down in both sens and in his descent the carven thing on every side of the tower and above and below once more take hold of and pervert his fancy so that he arrive at the bottom in a frame of mind eminently fit for a descent into the gau mukh which be nothing more terrible than a little spring fall into a reservoir in the side of the hill. 
he stumble across more ruin and pass between tomb of dead rani till he come to a flight of step build out and cut out from rock go down a far a he could see into a growth of tree on a terrace below him. the stone of the step have be wear and polish by the terrible naked foot till it show it marking clearly a agate. and where the step end in a rock slope there be a visible glair a great snail track upon the rock. it be hard to keep safe foot upon the sliminess. the air be thick with the sick smell of stale incense and grain of rice be scatter upon the step. but there be no one to be see. now this in itself be not specially alarm. but the genius of the place must be responsible for make it so. the englishman slip and bump on the rock and arrive more suddenly than he desire upon the edge of a dull blue tank sink between wall of timeless masonry. in a slabbed in recess water be pour through a shapeless stone gargoyle into a trough. which trough again drip into the tank. almost under the little trickle of water be the loathsome emblem of creation and there be flower and rice around it. water be trickle from a score of place in the cut face of the hill. ooze between the edge of the step and well up between the stone slab of the terrace. tree sprout in the side of the tank and hide it surround. it seem a though the descent have lead the englishman firstly two thousand year away from his own century and secondly into a trap and that he would fall off the polish stone into the stink tank or that the gau mukh would continue to pour water until the tank rise up and swamp him or that some of the stone slab would fall forward and crush him flat. 
then he be conscious of remember with peculiar and unnecessary distinctness that from the gau mukh a passage lead to the subterranean chamber in which the fair pudmini and her handmaid have slay themselves. and that tod have write and the station master at chitor have say that some sort of devil or ghoul or something stand at the entrance of that approach. all of which be a nightmare breed in full day and folly to boot. but it be the fault of the genius of the place who make the englishman feel that he have do a great wrong in trespass into the very heart and soul of all chitor. and behind him the gau mukh guggle and choke like a man in his death throe. the englishman endure a long a he could about two minute. then it come upon him that he must go quickly out of this place of year and blood must get back to the afternoon sunshine and gerowlia and the dak bungalow with the french bedstead. he desire no arch√¶ological information he wish to take no note and above all he do not care to look behind him where stand the reminder that he be no good than the beast that perish. but he have to cross the smooth wear rock and he felt their sliminess through his bootsoles. it be a though he be tread on the soft oil skin of a hindu. a soon a the step give refuge he flounder up them and so come out of the gau mukh bedew with that perspiration which follow alike on honest toil or childish fear. 
this say he to himself be absurd. and sit down on the fall top of a temple to review the situation. but the gau mukh have disappear. he could see the dip in the grind and the begin of the step but nothing more. 
perhaps it be absurd. it undoubtedly appear so late. yet there be something uncanny about it all. it be not exactly a feel of danger or pain but an apprehension of great evil. 
in defence it may be urge that there be moral just a much a there be mine choke damp. if you get into a place lade with the latter you die and if into the home of the former you. behave unwisely a constitution and temperament prompt. if any man doubt this let him sit for two hour in a hot sun on an elephant stay half an hour in the tower of victory and then go down into the gau mukh which it must never be forget be merely a set of spring three or four in number issue from the cliff face at cow mouth carving now mutilate. the water evidently percolate from the hathi kund above fall first in an old pillared hall and thence into the masonry reservoir below eventually when abundant enough supply a little waterfall low down. that gentleman and lady on the honour of one who ha be frighten of the dark in broad daylight be the gau mukh a though photograph. 
the englishman regain gerowlia and demand to be take away but gerowlia s driver go forward instead and show him a new mahal just build by the present maharana. carriage drive however do not consort well with chitor and the shadow of her ancient beauty. the return journey past temple after temple and palace upon palace begin in the fail light and gerowlia be still blunder up and down narrow by path for she possess all an old woman s delusion a to the slimness of her waist when the twilight fell and the smoke from the town below begin to creep up the brown flank of chitor and the jackal howl. then the sense of desolation which have be strong enough in all conscience in the sunshine begin to grow and grow. 
near the ram pol there be some semblance of a town with live people in it and a priest sit in the middle of the road and howl aloud upon his god until a little boy come and laugh in his face and he go away grumble. this touch be deeply refresh. in the contemplation of it the englishman clean forget that he have overlook the gather in of material for an elaborate statistical historical geographical account of chitor. all that remain to him be a shudder reminiscence of the gau mukh and two line of the holy grail. 
and up into the sound hall he pass but nothing in the sound hall he saw. 
post scriptum. there be something very uncanny about the genius of the place. he drag an ease love egotist out of the french bedstead with the gild knob at head and foot into a more than usually big folly nothing le than a see of chitor by moonlight. there be no possibility of get gerowlia out of her bed and a mistrust of the maharana s soldiery who in the day time guard the gate prompt the englishman to avoid the public way and scramble straight up the hillside along an attempt at a path which he have note from gerowlia s back. there be no one to interfere and nothing but an infinity of pestilent nullah and loose stone to check. owl come out and hoot at him and animal run about in the dark and make uncouth noise. it be an idiotic journey and it end oh horror. in that unspeakable gau mukh this time enter from the opposite or brushwooded side a far a could be make out in the dusk and from the chuckle of the water which by night be peculiarly malevolent. 
escape from this place crab fashion the englishman crawl into chitor and sit upon a flat tomb till the moon a very inferior and second hand one rise and turn the city of the dead into a city of scurry ghoul in sobriety jackal. the ruin take strange shape and shift in the half light and cast objectionable shadow. 
it be easy enough to fill the rock with the people of old time and a very beautiful account of chitor restore make out by the help of tod and bristle with the name of the illustrious dead would undoubtedly have be write have not a woman a live breathe woman steal out of a temple what be she do in that galley. and scream in pierce and public spirit fashion. the englishman get off the tomb and depart rather more noisily than a jackal. feel for the moment that he be not much good. somebody open a door with a crash and a man cry out. who be there. but the cause of the disturbance be for his sin be most horribly scratch by some thorny scrub over the edge of the hill there be no bastion worth speak of near the gau mukh and the rest be partly roll partly scramble and mainly bad language. 
when you be too lucky sacrifice something a beloved pipe for choice to ganesh. the englishman ha see chitor by moonlight not the best moonlight truly but the watery glare of a nearly spend moon and his sacrifice to luck be this. he will never try to describe what he ha see but will keep it a a love letter a thing for one pair of eye only a memory that few men to day can be sharer in. and doe he through this fiction evade insult by pen and ink a scene a lovely wild and unmatchable a any that mortal eye have be privilege to rest upon. 
an intelligent and discriminate public be perfectly at liberty to form their own opinion. 
xii. 
contain the history of the bhumia of jhaswara and the record of a visit to the house of strange story. demonstrate the felicity of loaferdom which be the veritable companionship of the indian empire and propose a scheme for the good officer of two department. 
come away from the monstrous gloom of chitor and escape northward. the place be unclean and terrify. let u catch to day by both hand and return to the station master who be also book parcel and telegraph clerk and who never seem to go to bed and to the comfortably wad bunk of the rajputana malwa line. 
while the train be run be please to listen to the perfectly true story of the bhumia of jhaswara which be a story the sequel whereof ha yet to be write. once upon a time a rajput landholder. a bhumia_ and a mahometan jaghirdar_ be next door neighbour in ajmir territory. they hat each other thoroughly for many reason all connect with land. and the jaghirdar be the big man of the two. in those day it be the law that the victim of robbery or dacoity should be reimburse by the owner of the land on which the affair have take place. the ordinance be now sweep away a impracticable. there be a highway robbery on the bhumia s hold. and he vow that it have be put up by the mahometan who he say be an ahab. the reive geld payable nearly ruin the rajput and he labour under a gall grievance or a groundless suspicion fire the jaghirdar s crop be detect and bring up before the english judge who give him four year imprisonment. to the sentence be append a recommendation that on release the rajput should be put on heavy security for good behaviour. otherwise write the judge who seem to have know the people he be deal with he will certainly kill the jaghirdar. four year pass and the jaghirdar obtain wealth and consideration and be make let u say a khan bahadur and an honorary magistrate. but the bhumia remain in gaol and think over the highway robbery. when the day of release come a new judge hunt up his predecessor s find and recommendation and would have put the bhumia on security. sahib say the bhumia_ i have no people. i have be in gaol. what be i now. and who will find security for me. if you will send me back to gaol again i can do nothing and i have no friend. so they release him and he go away into an outlying village and borrow a sword from one house and have it sharpen in another for love. two day late fell the birthday of the khan bahadur and the honorary magistrate and his friend and servant and dependant make a little levee and do him honour after the native custom. the bhumia also attend the levee but no one know him and he be stop at the door of the courtyard by the servant. say that the bhumia of jhaswara ha come to pay his salaam say he. they let him in and in the heart of ajmir city in broad daylight and before all the jaghirdar s household he smite off his enemy s head so that it roll upon the grind. then he flee and though they raise the countryside against him he be never catch and go into bikanir. 
five year late word come to ajmir that chimbo singh the bhumia of jhaswara have take service under the thakur sahib of palitana. the case be an old one and the chance of identification misty but the suspect be catch and bring in and one of the lead native barrister of the bombay bar be retain to defend him. he say nothing and continue to say nothing and the case fell through. he be believe to be want now for a fresh murder commit within the last few month out bikanir way. 
and now that the train ha reach ajmir the crewe of rajputana whither shall a tramp turn his foot. the englishman set his stick on end and it fell with it point northwest a nearly a might be. this be translate mean jodhpur which be the city of the houyhnhnm. if you would enjoy jodhpur thoroughly quit at ajmir the decent conventionality of station life and make it your business to move among gentleman gentleman in the ordnance or the commissariat or good still gentleman on the railway. at ajmir gentleman will tell you what manner of place jodhpur be and their account though flavour with oath be amuse. in their eye the desert that ring the city ha no charm and they discus affair of the state a they understand them in a manner that would curl the hair on a political s august head. jodhpur ha be but thing be rather good now a much favour camp grind for the light cavalry of the road the loafer with a certain amount of brain and great assurance. the explanation be simple. there be more than four hundred horse in his highness s city stable alone. and where the houyhnhnm be there also will be the yahoo. this be sad but true. 
besides the uhlans who come and go on heaven know what mysterious errand there be bag men travel for the big english firm. jodhpur be a good customer and purchase all sort of thing more or le useful for the state or it friend. these be the gentleman to know if you would understand something of matter which be not write in report. 
the englishman take a train from ajmir to marwar junction which be on the road to mount abu westward from ajmir and at five in the morning under pale moonlight be uncarted at the begin of the jodhpur state railway one of the quaint little line that ever run a locomotive. it be the maharaja s very own and pay about ten per cent. but it quaintness doe not lie in these thing. it be work with rude economy and start life by singularly and completely falsify the government estimate for it construction. an intelligent bureau assert that it could not be lay down for le than but the error shall be gloss over. it be lay down for a little more than seventeen thousand rupee a mile with the help of second hand rail and sleeper. and it be currently assert that the station master be flagmen pointsman ticket collector and everything else except platform and lamp room. a only two train be run in the twenty four hour this economy of staff doe not matter. the state line with the comparatively new branch to the pachpadra salt pit pay handsomely and be exactly suit to the need of it user. true there be a certain haziness a to the hour of start but this allow laggard more time and fill the pack carriage to overflow. 
from marwar junction to jodhpur the train leaf the aravalis and go northward into the region of death that lie beyond the luni river. sand ak bush and sand hill vary with occasional patch of unthrifty cultivation make up the scenery. rain ha be very scarce in marwar this year and the country consequently show at it bad for almost every square mile of a kingdom nearly a large a scotland be dependent on the sky for it crop. in a good season a large village can pay from seven to nine thousand rupee revenue without blench. in a bad one all the king s horse and all the king s men may think themselves lucky if they raise fifteen rupee from the same place. the fluctuation be startle. 
from a countryside which to the uninitiated seem about a valuable a a stretch of west african beach the state get a revenue of nearly forty lakh. and men who know the country vow that it ha not be one tithe exploit and that there be more to be make from salt marble and curious thing in this wilderness good forest conservancy than an open hand durbar dream of. an amiable weakness for unthinkingly give away village where ready cash fail ha somewhat hamper the revenue in past year. but now and for this the maharaja deserve great credit jodhpur ha a large and genuine surplus and a very compact little scheme of railway extension. before turn to a consideration of the city of jodhpur hear a true story in connection with the hyderabad pachpadra project which those interest in the scheme may lay to heart. 
his state line his own own a ha be say very much delight the maharaja who in one or two point be not unlike sir theodore hope of saint memory. please with the toy he say effusively in word which may or may not have reach the ear of the hyderabad pachpadra people. this be a good business. if the government will give me independent jurisdiction i ll make and open the line straight away from pachpadra to the end of my dominion i. e. all but to hyderabad. 
then up and spake an elder knight sit at the king s right knee who know something about the railway map of india and the control power of strategical line. maharaja sahib here be the indus valley state line and here be the bombay baroda line. where would you be. by jove quoth the maharaja though he swear by quite another god. i see. and thus he abandon the idea of a hyderabad line and turn his attention to an extension to nagore with a branch to the makrana marble quarry which be close to the sambhar salt lake near jeypore. and in the fulness of time that extension will be make and perhaps extend to bahawalpur. 
the englishman come to jodhpur at midday in a hot fierce sunshine that strike back from the sand and the ledge of red rock a though it be may instead of december. the line scorn such a thing a a regular ordain terminus. the single track gradually melt away into the sand. close to the station be a grim stone dak bungalow and in the verandah stand a brisk bag and flask begirdled individual crack his joint with excess of irritation. 
nota bene. when one be on the road it be above all thing necessary to pas the time o day to fellow wanderer. failure to comply with this law imply that the offender be too good for his company. and this on the road be the unpardonable sin. the englishman pass the time o day in due and ample form. ha. ha. say the gentleman with the bag. isn t this a sweet place. there ain t no ticca gharies_ and there ain t nothing to eat if you haven t bring your vittles an they charge you three eight for a bottle of whisky. oh. it s a sweet place. here he skip about the verandah and puff. then turn upon the englishman he say fiercely. what have you come here for. now this be rude because the ordinary form of salutation on the road be usually and what be you for. mean what house do you represent. the englishman answer dolefully that he be travel for pleasure which simple explanation offend the little man with the courier bag. he snap his joint more excruciatingly than ever. for pleasure. my god. for pleasure. come here an wait five week for your money an mark what i m tellin you now you don t get it then. but per aps your idea of pleasure be different from most people s. for pleasure. yah. he skip across the sand toward the station for he be go back with the down train and vanish in a whirlwind of luggage and the flutter of female skirt. in jodhpur the woman be baggage cooly. a level drawl voice speak from an inner room. e s a bite upset. that s what e be. i remember when i be at gworlior the rest of the story be lose and the englishman set to work to discover the nakedness of the dak bungalow. for reason which do not concern the public it be make a bitterly uncomfortable a possible. the food be infamous and the charge seem to be wilfully pitch about eighty per cent above the tariff so that some portion of the bill at least may be pay without bloodshed or the unseemly defilement of wall with the content of drink glass. this be short sight policy and it would perhaps be good to low the price and hide the tariff and put a guard about the house to prevent jackal molest donkey from stampede into the verandah. but these be detail. jodhpur dak bungalow be a merry merry place and any writer in search of new grind to locate a madly improbable story in could not do good than study it diligently. in front lie sand riddle with innumerable ant hole and beyond the sand the red sandstone wall of the city and the mahometan bury grind that fringe it. fragment of sandstone set on end mark the rest place of the faithful who be of no great account here. above everything a mark for mile around tower the dun red pile of the fort which be also a palace. this be set upon sandstone rock whose sharp feature have be wear smooth by the wash of the windblown sand. it be a monstrous a anything in dore s illustration of the contes drolatiques and wherever it wander the eye come back at last to it fantastic bulk. there be no greenery on the rock nothing but fierce sunlight or black shadow. a line of red hill form the background of the city and this be a bare a the pick bone of camel that lie bleach on the sand below. 
wherever the eye fall it see a camel or a string of camel lean racer build sowarri camel or heavy black shag haired trade ship bend on their way to the railway station. through the night the air be alive with the bubble and howl of the brute who assuredly must suffer from nightmare. in the morning the chorus round the station be deafen. 
know what these camel mean but trust nevertheless that the road would not be very bad the englishman go into the city leave a well kunkered road turn through a sand wear red sandstone gate and sink ankle deep in fine reddish white sand. this be the main thoroughfare of the city. two tame lynx share it with a donkey. and the rest of the population seem to have go to bed. in the hot weather between ten in the morning and four in the afternoon all jodhpur stay at home for fear of death by sun stroke and it be possible that the habit extend far into what be officially call the cold weather. or perhaps be bring up among sand men do not care to tramp them for pleasure. the city internally be a wall and secret place. each courtyard be hide from view by a red sandstone wall except in a few street where the shop be poor and mean. 
in an old house now use for the store of tent akbar s mother lay two month before the guardian of mankind be bear draw breath for her flight to umarkot across the desert. see this place the englishman think of many thing not worth the put down on paper and go on till the sand grow deep and deep and a great camel heavily lade with stone come round a corner and nearly step on him. a the even fell the city wake up and the goat and the camel and the kine come in by hundred and men say that wild pig which be strictly preserve by the prince for their own sport be in the habit of wander about the road. now if they do this in the capital what damage must they not do to the crop in the district. men say that they do a very great deal of damage and it be hard to keep their nose out of anything they take a fancy to. on the even of the englishman s visit the maharaja go out a be his laudable custom alone and unattended to a road actually in the city along which one specially big pig be in the habit of pass. his highness get his game with a single shoot behind the shoulder and in a few day it be pickle and send off to the maharana of udaipur a a love gift. there be great friendship between jodhpur and udaipur and the idea of one king go abroad to shoot game for another ha something very pretty and quaint in it. 
night fell and the englishman become aware that the conservancy of jodhpur might be vastly improve. strong stench say the doctor be of no importance. but there come upon every breath of heat air and in jodhpur city the air be warm in mid winter the faint sweet sickly reek that one ha always be teach to consider specially deadly. a few month ago there be an impressive outbreak of cholera in jodhpur and the residency doctor who really hop that the people would be bring to see sense do his best to bring forward a general cleanse scheme. but the city father would have none of it. their father have be try to poison themselves in well define way for an indefinite number of year. and they be not go to have any of the sahib s sweeper nonsense. 
to clinch everything one travel member of the community rise in his place and say. why i ve be to simla. yes to simla. and even i don t want it. 
when the black dusk have shut down the englishman climb up a little hill and saw the star come out and shine over the desert. very far away some camel driver have light a fire and be sing a they sit by the side of their beast. sound travel a far over sand a over water and their voice come into the city wall and beat against it in multiply echo. 
then he return to the house of strange story the dak bungalow and pass the time o day with a light hearted bagman a cockney in whose heart there be no think of india though he have travel for year throughout the length and breadth of the empire and over new burma a well. there be a fort in jodhpur but you see that be not in his line of business exactly and there be stable but you may take my word for it them who ha much to do with horse be a bad lot. you get hold of the maharaja s coachman and he ll drive you all round the shop. i m only wait here collect money. jodhpur dak bungalow seem to be full of men wait here. they lie in long chair in the verandah and tell each other interminable story or stare citywards and express their opinion of some dilatory debtor. they be all wait for something. and they vary the monotony of a life they make wilfully dull beyond word by wag war with the dak bungalow khansama. then they return to their long chair or their couch and sleep. some of them in old day use to wait a long a six week six week in may when the sixty mile from marwar junction to jodhpur be cover in three day by slow pace bullock cart. some of them be bagman able to describe the demerit of every dak bungalow from the peshin to pagan and southward to hyderabad men of substance who have the trade at their back. it be a terrible thing to be in the trade that great doomsday book of calcutta in whose page be write the name of doubtful client. let light hearted purchaser take note. 
and the others who wait and swear and spit and exchange anecdote what be they. bummer land shark skirmisher for their bread. it would be cruel in a fellow tramp to call them loafer. their lien upon the state may have it origin in horse or anything else. for the state buy anything vendible from abdul rahman s most promise importation to a patent self act corkscrew. they be a mix crew but amuse and full of strange story of adventure by land and sea. and their end be a curiously brutal a their life. a wanderer be once sweep into the great still back water that divide the loaferdom of upper india that be to say calcutta and bombay from the north go current of madras where nym and pistol be highly finish article with certificate of education. this back water be a dangerous place to break down in a the men on the road know well. you can run rajputana in a pair o sack breech an an old hat but go to central injia with money say the wisdom of the road. so the waif die in the bazaar and the barrack master sahib give order for his burial. it might have be the bazaar sergeant or it might have be an hireling who be charge with the disposal of the body. at any rate it be an irishman who say to the barrack master sahib. fwhat about that loafer. well what s the matter. i m considtherin whether i m to mash in his thick head or to break his long leg. he win t fit the store coffin anyways. 
here the story end. it may be an old one. but it strike the englishman a be rather unsympathetic in it nature. and he ha preserve it for this reason. be the englishman a mere secretary of state instead of an enviable and unshackled vagabond he would remodel that philanthropic institution of teach young subaltern how to spell variously call the intelligence and the political department and give each boy the pair of sack breech and old hat above prescribe would send him out for a twelvemonth on the road. not that he might learn to swear australian oath. which be superior to any one in the market. or to drink bazaar drink. which be very bad indeed. but in order that he might gain an insight into the tertiary politics of state thing le impose than succession case and le wearisome than boundary dispute but very well worth know. 
a small volume might be write of the way and the tale of indian loafer of the more brilliant order such chevalier of the order of industry a would throw their glass in your face do you call them loafer. they be a genial blasphemous bluster crew and pre√´minent even in a land of liar. 
xiii. 
a king s house and country. further consideration of the hat mark caste. 
the hospitality that spread table in the wilderness and shift the strange from the back of the hire camel into a two horse victoria must be experience to be appreciate. 
to those unacquainted with the peculiarity of the native train horse this advice may be worth something. sit a far back a ever you can and if oriental courtesy have put an english bite and bridoon in a mouth by education intend for a spike curb leave the whole contraption alone. once acquaint with the comparative smoothness of english iron mongery your mount will grow frivolous. in which event a four pound steeplechase saddle accept through sheer shame offer the very small amount of purchase to untrained leg. 
the englishman ride up to the fort and by the way learn all these thing and many more. he be provide with a rack female horse who sweep the gully of the city by dance sideways. 
the road to the fort which stand on the hill of strife wind in and out of sixty foot hill with a skilful avoidance of all shade. and this be at high noon when puff of heat air blow from the rock on all side. what must the heat be in may. the englishman s companion be a cheery brahmin who wear the light of turban and sit the small of neat little country breds. awful. say the brahmin. but not so bad a in the district. look there. and he point from the brow of a bad eminence across the quiver heat haze to where the white sand fade into bleach blue sky and the horizon be shake and tremulous. it s very bad in summer. would knock you oh yes all to smash but we be accustom to it. a rock strew hill about half a mile a the crow fly from the fort be point out a the place whence at the begin of this century the pretender sowae besiege raja maun for five month but could make no headway against his foe. one gun of the enemy s battery specially gall the fort and the jodhpur king offer a village to any of his gunner who should dismount it. it be smash say the brahmin. oh yes all to piece. practically the city which lie below the fort be indefensible and during the many war of marwar ha generally be take up by the assailant without resistance. 
enter the fort by the jeypore gate and studiously refrain from open his umbrella the englishman find shadow and coolth take off his hat to the tun belly trunk nose god of good luck who have be very kind to him in his wandering and sit down near half a dozen of the maharaja s gun bear the mark a. broome cossipore or g. hutchinson cossipore. now rock and masonry be so curiously blend in this great pile that he who walk through it lose sense of be among building. it be a though he walk through mountain gorge. the stone pave incline plane and the tunnel like passage drive under a hundred foot height of building increase this impression. in many place the wall and rock run up unbroken by any window for forty foot. 
it would be a week s work to pick out even roughly the name of the dead who have add to the building or to describe the bewilder multiplicity of court and range of room. and in the end the result would be a satisfactory a an attempt to describe a nightmare. it be say that the rock on which the fort stand be four mile in circuit but no man yet ha dare to estimate the size of the city that they call the palace or the mileage of it way. ever since ra joda four hundred year ago listen to the voice of a jogi_ and leave mundore build his eyrie on the bird s nest a the hill of strife be call the palace have grow and thicken. even to day the builder be still at work. takht singh the present ruler s predecessor build royally. an incomplete bastion and a hall of flower be among the work of his pleasure. hide away behind a mighty wing of carve red sandstone lie room set apart for viceroy durbar hall and dinner room without end. a gentle gloom cover the evidence of the catholic taste of the state in article of bigotry and virtue. but there be enough light to show the raison d √™tre of the men who wait in the dak bungalow. and after all what be the use of royalty in these day if a man may not take delight in the pride of the eye. kumbha rana the great man of chitor fight like a rajput but he have an instinct which make him build the tower of victory at who know what cost of money and life. the fight instinct throw back upon itself must have some sort of outlet. and a merciful providence wisely ordain that the king of the east in the nineteenth century shall take pleasure in shop on an imperial scale. dresden china snuff box mechanical engine electro plat fish slicer musical box and gild blow glass christmas tree ball do not go well with the splendour of a palace that might have be build by titan and colour by the morning sun. but there be excuse to be make for king who have no fight to do. 
in one of the high bastion stand a curious specimen of one of the early mitrailleuses a cumbrous machine carry twenty gun barrel in two row which small arm fire be flank by two tiny cannon. a a muzzle load implement it value after the first discharge would be insignificant. but the soldier lounge by assure the englishman that it have do good service in it time. 
a man may spend a long hour in the upper tier of the palace but still far from the roof top in look out across the desert. there be englishman in these waste who say gravely that there be nothing so fascinate a the sand of bikanir and marwar. you see explain an enthusiast of the hat mark caste you be not shut in by road and you can go just a you please. and somehow it grow upon you a you get use to it and you end y know by fall in love with the place. look steadily from the palace westward where the city with it tank and serais be spread at your foot and you will in a lame way begin to understand the fascination of the desert which by those who have felt it be say to be even strong than the fascination of the road. the city be of red sandstone and dull and sombre to look at. beyond it where the white sand lie the country be dot with camel limp into the eiwigkeit or come from the same place. tree appear to be strictly confine to the suburb of the city. very good. if you look long enough across the sand while a voice in your ear be tell you of half bury city old a old time and wholly unvisited by sahib of district where the white man be unknown and of the wonder of far away jeysulmir rule by a half distraught king sand lock and now smite by a terrible food and water famine you will if it happen that you be of a sedentary and civilise nature experience a new emotion will be conscious of a great desire to take one of the lob camel and get away into the desert away from the last touch of to day to meet the past face to face. some day a novelist will exploit the unknown land from the rann where the wild as breed northward and eastward till he come to the indus. 
but the official of marwar do not call their country a desert. on the contrary they administer it very scientifically and raise a ha be say about thirty eight lakh from it. to come back from the influence and the possible use of the desert to more prosaic fact. read quickly a rough record of thing in modern marwar. the old be draw in tod who speak the truth. the maharaja s right hand in the work of the state be maharaj sir pertab singh prime minister a. d. c. to the prince of wale capable of manage the marwari who intrigue like a marwari equally capable a ha be see of move in london society and colonel of a newly raise crack cavalry corp. the englishman would have like to have see him but he be away in the desert somewhere either mark a boundary or look after a succession case. not very long ago a the sett of ajmir know well there be a state debt of fifty lakh. this ha now be change into a surplus of three lakh and the revenue be grow. also the simple dacoit who use to enjoy himself very pleasantly ha be put into a department and the thug with him. 
consequently for the department take a genuine interest in this form of shikar_ and the gaol leg iron be not too light dacoity have be reduce to such an extent that men say you may send a woman with her ornament upon her from sojat to phalodi and she will not lose a nose ring. again and this in a rajput state be an important matter the boundary of nearly every village in marwar have be demarcate and boundary fight in which both side prefer small arm fire to the regulation club be unknown. the open hand system of give away village have raise a large and unmannerly crop of jaghirdars. these have be take up and bring in hand by sir pertab singh to the good order of the state. 
a punjabi sirdar har dyal singh ha reform or make rather court on the civil and criminal side. and his hand be say to be find in a good many sweeping out of old corner. it must always be bear in mind that everything that ha be do be carry through over and under unlimited intrigue for jodhpur be a native state. intrigue must be meet with intrigue by all except gordons or demi god. and it be curious to hear how a reduction in tariff or a smooth out of some tangle court have to be work by shift and byway. the tale be comic but not for publication. howbeit har dyal singh get his train in part under the punjab government and in part in a little native state far away in the himalaya where intrigue be not altogether unknown. to the credit of the pauper province be it say it be not easy to circumvent a punjabi. the detail of his work would be dry read. the result of it be good and there be justice in marwar and order and firmness in it administration. 
naturally the land revenue be the most interest thing in marwar from an administrative point of view. the basis of it be a tank about the size of a swim bath with a catchment of several hundred square yard drain through leeped channel. when god send the rain the people of the village drink from the tank. when the rain fail a they fail this year they take to their well which be brackish and breed guinea worm. for these reason the revenue like the republic of san domingo be never alike for two year run. there be no canal question to harry the authority. but the fluctuation be enormous. under the aravalis the soil be good. further north they grow millet and pasture cattle though say a revenue officer cheerfully god know what the brute find to eat. apropos of irrigation the one canal deserve special mention a show how george stephenson come to jodhpur and astonish the inhabitant. six mile from the city proper lie the balsaman sagar a great tank. in the hot weather when the city tank run out or stink it be the pleasant duty of the woman to tramp twelve mile at the end of the day s work to fill their lotahs. in the hot weather jodhpur be let a simile suffice. sukkur in june would be simla to jodhpur. 
the state engineer who be also the jodhpur state line for he ha no european subordinate conceive the idea of bring the water from the balsaman into the city. be the city grateful. not in the least. it be say that the sahib want the water to run uphill and be throw money into the tank. be true marwaris men bet on the subject. the canal a build out one for water must not touch earth in these part be make at a cost of something over a lakh and the water come down because it source be a trifle high than the city. now in the hot weather the woman need not go for long walk but the marwari cannot understand how it be that the water come down to jodhpur. from the marwari to money matter be an easy step. formerly that be to say up to within a very short time the treasury of jodhpur be conduct in a shiftless happy go lucky sort of fashion not uncommon in native state whereby the mahajuns hold the bag and make unholy profit on discount and other thing to the confusion of the durbar fund and their own enrichment. there be now a treasury model on english line and english in the important particular that money be not to be get from it for the ask and the item of expenditure be strictly look after. 
in the middle of all this bustle of reform plan achieve frustrate and replanned and the never end underground warfare that surge in a native state move the english officer the irreducible minimum of exile. a a caste the work englishman in native state be curiously interest. and the traveller whose tact by this time ha be blunt by tramp sit in judgment upon them a he ha see them. in the first place they be they must be the fit who have survive. for though here and there you shall find one chafe bitterly against the burden of his life in the wilderness one to be pity more than any chain beast the bulk of the caste be honestly and unaffectedly fond of their work fond of the country around them and fond of the people they deal with. in each state their answer to a question be the same. the men with whom they be in contact be all right when you know them but you ve get to know them first a the music hall song say. their hand be full of work. so full that when the incult wanderer say. what do you find to do. they look upon him with contempt and amazement exactly a the wanderer himself have once look upon a globe trotter who have put to him the same impertinent query. and but here the englishman may be wrong it seem to him that in one respect their life be a good deal more restful and concentrate than those of their brother under the british government. there be no talk of shifting and transfer and promotion stretch across a province and a half and no man say anything about simla. to one who ha hitherto believe that simla be the hub of the empire it be disconcert to hear. oh simla. that s where you bengali go. we haven t anything to do with simla down here. and no more they have. their talk and their interest run in the boundary of the state they serve and most strike of all the gossipy element seem to be cut altogether. it be a backwater of the river of anglo indian life or be it the main current the broad stream that supply the motive power and be the other life only the noisy ripple on the surface. you who have live not merely look at both life decide. much can be learn from the talk of the caste many curious many amuse and some startle thing. one hear story of men who take a poor impoverish state a a man take a wife for good or bad and move by some incomprehensible ideal of virtue consecrate that be not too big a word consecrate their life to that state in all single heartedness and purity. such men be few but they exist to day and their name be great in land where no englishman travel. again the listener hear tale of grizzle diplomat of rajputana machiavelli who have hoist a powerful intriguer with his own intrigue and best priestly cunning and the guile of the oswal simply that the way might be clear for some scheme which should put money into a totter treasury or lighten the taxation of a few hundred thousand men or both. for this can be do. one tithe of that force spend on their own personal advancement would have carry such men very far. 
truly the hat mark caste be a strange people. they be so few and so lonely and so strong. they can sit down in one place for year and see the work of their hand and the prompting of their brain grow to actual and beneficent life bring good to thousand. le fetter than the direct servant of the indian government and work over a much vast charge they seem a big and a more large mind breed. and that be say a good deal. 
but let the others the little people bind down and supervise and strictly limit and income tax always remember that the hat mark be very badly off for shop. if they want a neck tie they must get it up from bombay and in the rain they can hardly move about. and they have no amusement and must go a day s railway journey for a rubber and their drink water be doubtful. and there be le than one white woman per ten thousand square mile. 
after all comparative civilisation ha it advantage. 
xiv. 
among the houyhnhnm. 
jodhpur differ from the other state of rajputana in that it royalty be peculiarly accessible to an inquire public. there be wanderer the desire of whose life it be to see nabob which be the globe trotter s title for any one in unusually clean clothe or an oudh taluqdar in gala dress. men ask in jodhpur whether the englishman would like to see his highness. the englishman have a great desire to do so if his highness would be in no way inconvenience. then they scoff. oh he win t durbar you you needn t flat yourself. if he s in the humour he ll receive you like an english country gentleman. how in the world could the owner of such a place a jodhpur palace be in any way like an english country gentleman. the englishman have not long to wait in doubt. his highness intimate his readiness to see the englishman between eight and nine in the morning at the raika bagh. the raika bagh be not a palace for the low storey and all the detach building round it be fill with horse. nor can it in any way be call a stable because the upper storey contain sumptuous apartment full of all manner of valuable both of the east and the west. nor be it in any sense a pleasure garden for it stand on soft white sand close to a multitude of litter and sand train track and be devoid of tree for the most part. therefore the raika bagh be simply the raika bagh and nothing else. it be now the choose residence of the maharaja who love to live among his four hundred or more horse. all jodhpur be horse mad by the way and it behove any one who wish to be any one to keep his own race course. the englishman go to the raika bagh which stand half a mile or so from the city and pass through a long room fill with saddle by the dozen bridle by the score and bit by the hundred be aware of a very small and lively little cherub on the roof of a garden house. he be carefully muffle for the morning be chill. good morning he cry cheerfully in english wave a mittened hand. be you go to see my faver and the horse. it be the maharaja kanwar the crown prince the apple of the maharaja s eye and one of the quaint little body that ever set an englishman disrespectfully laugh. he study english daily with one of the english official of the state and stand a very good chance of be thoroughly spoil for he be a general pet. a befit his dignity he ha his own carriage or carriage his own twelve hand stable his own house and retinue. 
a few step further on in a little enclosure in front of a small two storied white bungalow sit his highness the maharaja deep in discussion with the state engineer. he wear an english ulster and within ten pace of him be the first of a long range of stall. there be an informality of procedure about jodhpur which after the strain etiquette of other state be very refresh. the state engineer who ha a grow line to attend to canter away and his highness after a few introductory word know what the englishman would be after say. come along and look at the horse. other formality there be absolutely none. even the indispensable knot of hanger on stand at a distance and behind a pal in this most rustic country residence. a well breed fox terrier take command of the proceeding after the manner of dog the world over and the maharaja lead to the horse box. but a man turn up bend under the weight of much bacon. oh. here s the pig i shoot for udaipur last night. you see that be the best piece. it s pickle and that s what make it yellow to look at. he pat the great side that be hold up. there will be a camel sowar to meet it half way to udaipur. and i hope udaipur will be please with it. it be a very big pig. and where do you shoot it maharaja sahib. here say his highness smite himself high up under the armpit. where else would you have it. certainly this descendant of raja maun be more like an english country gentleman than the englishman in his ignorance have deem possible. he lead on from horse box to horse box the terrier at his heel point out each horse of note. and jodhpur ha many. there s raja_ twice winner of the civil service cup. the englishman look reverently and raja reward his curiosity with a vicious snap for he be be dress over and his temper be out of joint. close to him stand autocrat_ the grey with the nutmeg mark on the off shoulder a picture of a horse also disturb in his mind. next to him be a chestnut arab a hopeless cripple for one of his knee have be smash and the leg be double up under him. it be turquoise_ who six or eight year ago reward good feed by get away from his groom fall down and ruin himself but who none the le ha live an honour pensioner on the maharaja s bounty ever since. no horse be shoot in the jodhpur stable and when one dy they have lose not more than twenty five in six year his funeral be an event. he be wrap in a white sheet which be strew with flower and amid the weep of the saises_ be bear away to the burial grind. 
after do the honour for nearly half an hour the maharaja depart and a the englishman ha not see more than forty horse he felt justify in demand more. and he get them. eclipse and young revenge be out down country but sherwood at the stud shere ali_ conqueror_ tynedale_ sherwood ii_ a maiden of abdul rahman s and many others of note be in and be bring out. among the veteran a wrathful rampant red horse still come brian boru_ whose name ha be write large in the chronicle of the indian turf jerk his sais across the road. his near fore be altogether go but a a pensioner he condescend to go in harness and be then say to be a handful. he certainly look it. 
at the two hundred and fifty seventh horse and perhaps the twentieth block of stable the englishman s brain begin to reel and he demand rest and information on a certain point. he have go into some fifty stall and look into all the rest and in the look have searchingly sniff. but a truly a he be then stand far below brian boru s bony wither never the ghost of a stench have pollute the keen morning air. the city of the houyhnhnm be specklessly clean clean than any stable race or private that he have be into. how be it do. the pure white sand account for a good deal and the rest be explain by one of the master of horse. each horse ha one sais at least old ringwood ha four and we make em work. if we didn t we d be muck up to the horse belly in no time. everything be clean off at once. and whenever the sand s taint it s renew. there s quite enough sand you see hereabouts. of course we can t keep their coat so good a in other stable by reason of the roll. but we can keep em pretty clean. 
to the eye of one who know le than nothing about horse flesh this immaculate purity be very strike and quite a impressive be the condition of the horse which be english quite english. naturally none of them be in any sort of train beyond daily exercise but they be fit and in such thoroughly good fettle. many of them be out on the various track and many be come in. roughly two hundred go out of a morning and it be to be fear learn from the heavy go of the jodhpur course how to hang in their stride. this be a matter for those who know but it strike the englishman that a good deal of the unsatisfactory performance of the jodhpur stable might be account for by their have lose their clean stride on the sand and have to pick it up gradually on the le hold down country course unfortunately when they be not do train gallop but the real thing. 
it be pleasant to sit down and watch the rush of the horse through the great open gate be not affect go on to the countryside where they take the air. here a boisterous unschooled arab shoot out across the road and cry ha. ha. in the scriptural manner before try to rid himself of the grin black imp on his back. behind him a cabuli surely all cabulis must have be bear with pelham in their mouth bore sulkily across the road or throw himself across the path of a tall mild eye kurnal breed youngster whose cock ear and swing head show that though he be so sedate he be thoroughly take in his surround and would very much like to know if there be anybody good than himself on the course that morning. impetuous a a schoolboy and irresponsible a a monkey one of the prince s polo pony not above race in his own set would answer the question by riot past the pupil of parrott the monogram on his bodycloth flap free in the wind and his head and hog tail in the element. the youngster would swing himself round and polka mazurka for a few pace till his attention would be catch by some dainty child of the desert fresh from the bombay stable sweat at every sound back and fill like a rudderless ship. then thank his star that he be wise than some people number would lob on to the track and settle down to his spin like the gentleman he be. elsewhere the eye fell upon a cloud of nameless one purchase from abdul rahman whose worth will be prove next hot weather when they be seriously take in hand skirmish over the face of the land and enjoy themselves immensely. high above everything else like a collier among barge scream shrilly a black flamboyant marwari stallion with a crest like the crest of a barb barrel belly goose rumped and river man prance through the press while the slow pace waler carriage horse eye him with deep disfavour and the maharaja kanwar s tiny mount caper under his pink roman nose kick up a much dust a the foxhall colt who have get on to a lovely patch of sand and be dance a saraband in it. in and out of the tangle go down to or come back from the course run shuffle rocket plunge sulk or stampede countless horse of all kind shape and description so that the eye at last fail to see what they be and only retain a general impression of a whirl of bay grey iron grey and chestnut with white stocking some a good a could be desire others average but not one distinctly bad. 
we have no downright bad un in this stable. what s the use. say the master of horse calmly. they be all good beast and one with another must cost more than a thousand rupee each. this year s new one buy from bombay and the pick of our own stud be a hundred strong about. may be more. yes they look all right enough. but you can never know what they be go to turn out. live stock be very uncertain. and how be the stable manage. how do you make room for the fresh stock. something this way. here be all the new one and parrott s lot and the english colt that maharaja pertab singh bring out with him from home. winterlake out o queen s consort that chestnut be with the two white stocking you re look at now. well next hot weather we shall see what they re make of and which be who. there s so many that the trainer hardly know em one from another till they begin to be a good deal forward. those that haven t get the pace or that the maharaja don t fancy they re take out and sell for what they ll bring. the man who take the horse out ha a good job of it. he come back and say. i sell such and such for so much and here s the money. that s all. well our rejection be worth have. they have take prize at the poona horse show. see for yourself. be there one of those that you wouldn t be glad to take for a hack and look well after too. only they re no use to u and so out they go by the score. we ve get sixty rid boy perhaps more and they ve get their work cut out to keep them all go. what you ve see be only the stable. we ve get one stud at bellara eighty mile out and they come in sometimes in drove of three and four hundred from the stud. they raise marwaris there too but that s entirely under native management. we ve get nothing to do with that. the native reckon a marwari the best country breed you can lay hand on. and some of them be beauty. crest on em like the top of a wave. well there s that stud and another stud and reckon one with another i should say the maharaja ha near twelve hundred than a thousand horse of his own. for this place here two wagon load of grass come in every day from marwar junction. lord know how many saddle and bridle we ve get. i never count. i suppose we ve about forty carriage not count the one that get shabby and be stack in place in the city a i suppose you ve see. we take em out in the morning a regular string altogether brake and all. but the pretty turn out we ever turn out be lady dufferin s pony four in hand. walers thirteen two the wheeler i think and thirteen one the leader. they take prize in poona. that be a pretty turn out. the pretty in india. lady dufferin she drive it when the viceroy be down here last year. there be bicycle and tricycle in the carriage department too. i don t know how many but when the viceroy s camp be hold there be about one apiece for the gentleman with remount. they re somewhere about the place now if you want to see them. how do we manage to keep the horse so quiet. you ll find some o the youngster play the goat a good deal when they come out o stable but a you say there s no vice generally. it s this way. we don t allow any curry comb. if we do the saises would be wear out their brush on the comb. it s all elbow grease here. they ve get to go over the horse with their hand. they must handle em and a native he s afraid of a horse. now an english groom when a horse be do the fool clip him over the head with a curry comb or punch him in the belly. and that hurt the horse s feeling. a native he just stand back till the trouble be over. he must handle the horse or he d get into trouble for not dress him so it come to all handle and no lick and that s why you win t get hold of a really vicious brute in these stable. old ringwood he have four saises_ and he want em every one but the other horse have no more than one sais apiece. the maharaja he keep fourteen or fifteen horse for his own rid. not that he care to ride now but he like to have his horse. and no one else can touch em. then there s the horse that he mount his visitor on when they come for pig stick and such like and then there s a lot of horse that go to maharaja pertab singh s new cavalry regiment. so you see a horse can go through all three degree sometimes before he get sell and be a good horse at the end of it. and i think that s about all. 
a cloud of youngster sweat freely and ready for any mischief shoot past on their way to breakfast and the conversation end in a cloud of sand and the drum of hurry hoof. 
in the raika bagh be more race cup than this memory hold the name of. chief of all be the delhi assemblage cup the imperial vase of solid gold win by crown prince. the other piece of plate be not so impose. but of all the crown jewel the most valuable appear at the end of the inspection. it be the small maharaja kanwar loll in state in a huge barouche his toe be at least two foot off the floor that be take him from his morning drive. have you see my horse. say the maharaja kanwar. the four twelve hand pony have be duly look over and the future ruler of jodhpur depart satisfy.

treat of the startle effect of a reduction in wage and the pleasure of loaferdom. paint the state of the boondi road and the treachery of ganesh of situr. 
a twenty five per cent reduction all roun an no certain leave when you want it. of course the best men go somewhere else. that s only natural and ere s this sanguinary down mail a stickin in the eye of the khundwa down. i tell you sir injia s a bad place a very bad place. tisn t what it be when i come out one and thirty year ago an the driver be get their seven and eight undred rupee a month an be treat a men. 
the englishman be on his way to nasirabad and a gentleman in the railway be explain to him the real reason of the decadence of the empire. it be because the rajputana malwa railway have cut all it employ√©s twenty five per cent. it be ungenerous to judge a caste by a few sample. but the englishman have on the road and elsewhere see a good deal of gentleman on the railway and they spend their pay in a manner that would do credit to an income of a thousand a month. now they say that the twenty five per cent reduction deprive them of all the pleasure of life. so much the good if it make them moderately economical in their expenditure. revolve these thing in his mind together with one or two story of extravagance not quite fit for publication the englishman come to nasirabad before sunrise and there to an evil look tonga. quoth ram baksh proprietor driver sais_ and everything else calmly. at this time of the year and have regard to the heat of the sun who want a top to a tonga. i have no top. i have a top but it would take till twelve o clock to put it on. and behold sahib padre martum sahib go in this tonga to deoli. all the officer sahib of deoli and nasirabad go in this tonga for shikar. this be a shutin tonga. when church and army be bring against one argument be in vain. but to take a soft office breed unfortunate into the wilderness upon a skeleton a diagram of a conveyance be brutality. ram baksh do not see it and head his two thirteen hand rat straight towards the morning sun along a beautiful military road. we shall get to deoli in six hour say ram baksh the boastful and even a he speak the spring of the tonga bar snapt mit a harp like melodious twang. what doe it matter. say ram baksh. ha the sahib never see a tonga iron break before. padre martum sahib and all the officer sahib in deoli ram baksh say the englishman sternly i be not a padre sahib nor an officer sahib and if you say anything more about padre martum sahib or the officer in deoli i shall grow very angry ram baksh. 
humph say ram baksh i know you be not a padre sahib. the little mishap be patch up with string and the tonga go on merrily. it be stevenson who say that the invitation to the road nature s great morning song ha not yet be properly understand or put to music. the first note of it be the sound of the dawn wind through long grass. it be good good beyond expression to see the sun rise upon a strange land and to know that you have only to go forward and posse that land that it will dower you before the day be end with a hundred new impression and perhaps one idea. it be good to snuff the wind when it come in over large upland or down from the top of the blue aravalis dry and keen a a new grind sword. best of all be to light the first pipe be there any tobacco so good a that we burn in honour of the break day. and while the pony wake the long white road with their hoof and the bird go abroad in companion together to thank your star that you be neither the subaltern who ha orderly room the stunt who ha office or the judge who ha the court to attend. but be only a loafer in a flannel shirt bind if god plea to little boondi somewhere beyond the faint hill beyond the plain. 
but there be alloy in this delight. men have tell the englishman darkly that boondi state have no love for englishman that there be nowhere to stop and that no one would do anything for money. love be out of the question. further it be an acknowledge fact that there be no englishman of any kind in boondi. but the englishman trust that ganesh would be good to him and that he would somehow or other fall upon his foot a he have fall before. the road from nasirabad to deoli be military in it nature be nearly a straight a a ruler and about a smooth. here and there little rocky hill the last off shoot of the aravalis to the west break the grind. but the bulk of it be fair and without pimple. the deoli force be apparently so utterly irregular that they can do without a telegraph have their mail carry by runner and dispense with bridge over all the fifty six mile that separate them from nasirabad. however a man who go shikarring for any length of time in one of ram baksh s tonga would soon learn to dispense with anything and everything. _all the sahib use my tonga. i ve get eight of them and twenty pair of horse say ram baksh. they go a far a gangra where the tiger be for they be shutin tonga. now the englishman know gangra slightly have see it on the way to udaipur. and it be a perverse and rocky a place a any man would desire to see. he politely express doubt. i tell you my tonga go anywhere say ram baksh testily. a hay wagon they cut and stack their hay in these part block the road. ram baksh run the tonga to one side into a rut fetch up on a tree stump rebound on to a rock and strike the road again. observe say ram baksh. but that be nothing. you wait till we get on the boondi road and i ll make you shake shake like a bottle. be it very bad. i ve never be to boondi myself but i hear it be all rock great rock a big a this tonga. but though he boast himself and his horse nearly all the way he could not reach deoli in anything like the time he have set forth. if i be not at boondi by four he have say at six in the morning let me go without my fee. but by midday he be still far from deoli and boondi lay twenty eight mile beyond that station. what can i do. say he. i ve lay out lot of horse any amount. but the fact be i ve never be to boondi. i shan t go there in the night. ram baksh s lot of horse be three pair between nasirabad and deoli three pair of undersized pony who do wonder. at one place after he have quit a cotton wagon a drive of gipsy and a man on horseback with his carbine across his saddle bow the englishman come to a stretch of road so utterly desolate that he say. now i be clear of everybody who ever know me. this be the begin of the waste into which the scape goat be send. 
from a bush by the roadside spring up a fat man who cry aloud in english. how doe your honour do. i meet your honour in simla this year. be you quite well. ya a i be here. your honour remember me. i be travel. ya a. ha. ha. and he go on leave his honour bemazed. it be a babu a simla babu of that there could be no doubt. but who he be or what he be do thirty mile from anywhere his honour could not make out. the native move about more than most folk except railway people imagine. the big bank firm of upper india naturally keep in close touch with their great change house in ajmir despatch and receive messenger regularly. so it come to pas that the necessitous circumstance of lieutenant mcrannamack of the tyneside tailtwisters quarter on the frontier be thoroughly know and discuss a thousand mile south of the cantonment where the light hearted lieutenant go to his money lender. 
this be by the way. let u return to the bank of the banas river where poor carey a tod call him come when he be sicken for his last illness. the banas be one of those stream which run over golden sand with foot of silver but from the scarp of it bank deoli in the rain must be isolate. ram baksh question hereon vow that all the officer sahib never dream of halt but go over in boat or on elephant. accord to ram baksh the men of deoli must be wonderful creature. they do nothing but use his tonga. a break in some low hill give on to the dead flat plain in which deoli stand. you must stop here for the night say ram baksh. i will not take my horse forward in the dark. god know where the dak bungalow be. i ve forget but any one of the officer sahib in deoli will tell you. 
those in search of a new emotion would do well to run about an apparently empty cantonment in a disgraceful shoot tonga hunt for a place to sleep in. chaprassis come out of back verandah and be rude and regimental babu hop off godown and be flippant while in the distance a sahib look out of his room and eye the dusty forlorn hope with silent contempt. it should be mention that the dust on the deoli road not only powder but mask the face and raiment of the passenger. 
next morning ram baksh be awake with the dawn and clamorous to go on to boondi. i ve send a pair of horse big horse out there and the sais be a fool. perhaps they will be lose. i want to find them. he drag his unhappy passenger on the road once more and demand of all who pass the dak bungalow which be the way to boondi. observe say he there can be only one road and if i hit it we be all right and i ll show you what the tonga can do. amen say the englishman devoutly a the tonga jump into and out of a large hole. without doubt this be the boondi road say ram baksh. it be so bad. 
it ha be before say that the boondi state ha no great love for sahib. the state of the road prof it. this say ram baksh tap the wheel to see whether the last plunge have smash a speak be a very good road. you wait till you see what be ahead. and the funeral stagger on over irrigation cut through buffalo wallow and dry pool stamp with the hundred foot of kine. this by the way be the most cruel road of all. up rough bank where the rock ledge peer out of the dust down steep cut dip ornament with large stone and along two foot deep rut of the rain where the tonga go slantwise even to the verge of upset. it be a royal road a native road a raj road of the rough and through all it jolt and bang and bump and dip and heave the eye of ram baksh roll in it blood shoot socket seek for the big horse he have so rashly send into the wilderness. the pony that have do the last twenty mile into deoli be nearly use up and do their best to lie down in the dry bed of nullah. 
a man come by on horseback his servant walk before with platter and meal bag. have you see any horse hereabouts. cry ram baksh. horse. what the devil have i to do with your horse. d you think i ve steal them. now this be decidedly a strange answer and show the rudeness of the land. an old woman under a tree cry out in a strange tongue and run away. it be a dream like experience this hunt for horse in a wilderness with neither house nor hut nor shed in sight. if we keep to the road long enough we must find them. look at the road. this raj ought to be smite with bullet. ram baksh have be pitch forward nearly on the off pony s rump and be in a very bad temper indeed. the funeral find a house a house wall with thorn and near by be two big horse thirteen two if an inch and harness quite regardless of expense. 
everything be repacked and rebound with triple rope and the sahib be provide with an extra cushion. but he have reach a sort of dreamsome nirvana have several time bite his tongue through cut his boot against the wheel edge and twist his leg into a true lover knot. there be no further sense of suffer in him. he be even begin to enjoy himself faintly and by gasp. the road strike boldly into hill with all their teeth on edge that be to say their stratum break across the road in little ripple. the effect of this be amaze. the tonga skip merrily a a young fawn from ridge to ridge. it shiver it palpitate it shake it slide it hop it waltz it ricochet it bound like a kangaroo it blunder like a sledge it sway like a top heavy coach on a down grade it kick like a badly couple railway carriage it squelch like a country cart it squeak in it torment and lastly it essay to plough up the grind with it nose. after three hour of this performance it strike a tiny little ford set between steeply slop bank of white dust where the water be clear brown and full of fish. and here a blissful halt be call under the shadow of the high bank of a tobacco field. 
would you taste one of the real pleasure of life. go through severe acrobatic exercise in and about a tonga for four hour. then have eat and drink till you can no more sprawl in the cool of a nullah bed with your head among the green tobacco and your mind adrift with the one little cloud in a royally blue sky. earth ha nothing more to offer her child than this deep delight of animal well be. there be butterfly in the tobacco six different kind and a little rat come out and drink at the ford. to him succeed the flight into egypt. the white bank of the ford frame the picture perfectly the mother in blue on a great white donkey hold the child in her arm and joseph walk beside his hand upon the donkey s wither. by all the law of the east joseph should have be rid and the mother walk. this be an exception decree for the englishman s special benefit. it be very warm and very pleasant and somehow the passer by the ford grow indistinct and the nullah become a big english garden with a cuckoo sing far down in the orchard among the apple blossom. the cuckoo start the dream. he be the only real thing in it for on wake the garden slip back into the water but the cuckoo remain and call and call for all the world a though he have be a veritable english cuckoo. cuckoo cuckoo cuck. then a pause and renewal of the cry from another quarter of the horizon. after that the ford become distasteful so the procession be drive forward and in time plunge into what must have be a big city once but the only inhabitant be oil men. there be abundance of tomb here and one carry a life like carve in high relief of a man on horseback spear a foot soldier. hard by this place the road or rut turn by great garden very cool and pleasant full of tomb and black face monkey who quarrel among the tomb and shut in from the sun by gigantic banian and mango tree. under the tree and behind the wall priest sit sing. and the englishman would have inquire into what strange place he have fall but the men do not understand him. 
ganesh be a mean little god of circumscribe power. he be dream with a red and flush face under a banian tree. and the englishman give him four anna to arrange matter comfortably at boondi. his priest take the four anna but ganesh do nothing whatever a shall be show late. his only excuse be that his trunk be a good deal wear and he would have be good for some more silver leaf but that be no fault of the englishman. 
beyond the dead city be a jhil full of snipe and duck wind in and out of the hill. and beyond the jhil hide altogether among the hill be boondi. the near to the city the vile grow the road and the more overwhelm the curiosity of the inhabitant. but what befel at boondi must be reserve for another chapter. 
xvi. 
the comedy of error and the exploitation of boondi. the castaway of the dispensary and the child of the school. a consideration of the shield of rajasthan and other trifle. 
it be high time that a new treaty be make with maha rao raja ram singh bahadur raja of boondi. he keep the third article of the old one too faithfully which say that he shall not enter into negotiation with any one without the consent of the british government. he doe not negotiate at all. arrive at boondi gate the englishman ask where he might lay his head for the night and the quarter guard with one accord say. the sukh mahal which be beyond the city and the tonga go thither through the length of the town till it arrive at a pavilion on a lake a place of two turret connect by an open colonnade. the house be open to the wind of heaven and the pigeon of the raj. but the latter have pollute more than the first could purify. a snowy beard chowkidar crawl out of a place of tomb which he seem to share with some monkey and throw himself into anglo saxon attitude. he be a great deal bad than ram baksh for he say that all the officer sahib of deoli come to the sukh mahal for shikar and never go away again so please be they. the sahib have bring the honour of his presence and he be a very old man and without a write permit could do nothing. then he fell deeply asleep without warn. and there be a pause of one hour only which the englishman spend in see the lake. it like the jhils on the road wind in and out among the hill and on the bund side be bound by a hill of black rock crown with a chhatri of grey stone. below the bund be a garden a fair a eye could wish and the shore of the lake be dot with little temple. give a habitable house a mere dak bungalow it would be a delightful spot to rest in. warn by some bitter experience in the past the englishman know that he be in for the demi semi royal or embarrass reception when a man be the unwelcome guest of a paternal state be neither allow to pay his way and make himself comfortable nor be he willingly entertain. when he saw a one eye munshi. clerk. he felt certain that ganesh have turn upon him at last. the munshi demand and receive the purwana_ or write permit. then he sit down and question the traveller exhaustively a to his character and profession. have thoroughly satisfy himself that the visitor be in no way connect with the government or the agenty sahib bahadur he take no further think of the matter and the day begin to draw in upon a grassy bund an open work pavilion and a disconsolate tonga. 
at last the faithful servitor who have help to fight the battle of the mail bag at udaipur break his silence and vow that all these devil people not more than twelve have only come to see the fun suggest the break of the munshi s head. and indeed that seem the best way of break the ice. for the munshi have in the polite possible language put forward the suggestion that there be nothing particular to show that the sahib who hold the purwana have really any right to hold it. the chowkidar wake up and chant a weird chant accompany by the anglo saxon attitude a new set. he be an old man and all the sahib log say so and within the pavilion be table and chair and lamp and bath tub and everything that the heart of man could desire. even now an enormous staff of menial be arrange all these thing for the comfort of the sahib bahadur and protector of the poor who have bring the honour and glory of his presence all the way from deoli. what do table and chair and egg and fowl and very bright lamp matter to the raj. he be an old man and. who put the present raja on the throne. lake sahib promptly answer the chowkidar. i be there. that be the news of many old year. now tod say it be he himself who instal lalji the beloved in the year. the englishman begin to lose faith in the chowkidar. the munshi say nothing but follow the englishman with his one workable eye. a merry little breeze crisp the water of the lake and the fish begin to frolic before go to bed. 
be nobody go to do or bring anything. say the englishman faintly wonder whether the local gaol would give him a bed if he kill the munshi. i be an old man say the chowkidar_ and because of their great respect and reverence for the sahib in whose presence i be only a bearer of order and a servant await them men many men be bring now tent fly which i with my own hand will wrap here and there there and here in and about the pillar of the place. and thus you o sahib who have bring the honour of your presence to the boondi raj over the road to deoli which be a kutcha road will be provide with a very fine and large apartment over which i will watch while you go to kill the tiger in these hill. 
by this time two youth have twist canvas round some of the pillar of the colonnade make a sort of loose box with a two foot air way all round the top. there be no door but there be unlimited window. into this enclosure the chowkidar heap furniture on which many generation of pigeon have evidently be carry off by cholera until he be entreat to desist. what say he scornfully be table and chair to this raj. if six be not enough let the presence give an order and twelve shall be forthcoming. everything shall be forthcoming. here he fill a native lamp with kerosene oil and set it in a box upon a stick. luckily the oil which he pour so lavishly from a quart bottle be bad or he would have be altogether consume. 
night have fall long before this magnificence be end. the superfluous furniture chair for the most part be shovel out into the darkness and by the light of a flamboyant lamplet a merry wind forbid candle the englishman go to bed and be lull to sleep by the rush of the water escape from the overflow trap and the splash of the water turtle a he miss the evasive fish. it be a curious sight. cat and dog riot about the enclosure and a wind from the lake belly the canvas. the brushwood of the hill around snap and crack a beast go through it and creature not jackal make dolorous noise. on the lake it seem that hundred of water bird be keep a hotel and that there be arrival and departure throughout the night. the raj insist upon provide a guard of two sepoys very pleasant men on four rupee a month. these say that tiger sometimes wander about on the hill above the lake but be most generally to be find five mile away. and the englishman promptly dream that a one eye tiger come into his tent without a purwana. but it be only a wild cat after all. and it flee before the shoe of civilisation. 
the sukh mahal be completely separate from the city and might have be a country house. it should be mention that boondi be jam into a v shape gorge the valley at the main entrance be something le than five hundred yard across. a it splay out the thickly pack house follow it line and see from above seem like cattle herd together preparatory to a stampede through the gate. owe to the set of the hill very little of the city be visible except from the palace. it be in search of this latter that the englishman go abroad and become so interest in the street that he forget all about it for a time. jeypore be a show city and be decently drain. udaipur be bless with a state engineer and a print form of government. for jodhpur the dry sand the burn sun and an energetic doctor have do a good deal but boondi ha none of these thing. the crampedness of the locality aggravate the evil and it can only be in the rain which channel and furrow the rocky hillside that boondi be at all sweep out. the nal sagar a lovely little stretch of water take up the head of the valley call banda gorge and must in the nature of thing receive a good deal of unholy drainage. but set aside this weakness it be a fascinate place this jumble city of straight street and cool garden where gigantic mango and peepul intertwine over gurgle watercourse and the cuckoo come at midday. it boast no foolish municipality to decree when a house be dangerous and uninhabitable. the new shop be build into on to over and under time blacken ruin of an old day and the little child skip about totter arcade and grass grow wall while their parent chatter below in the crowd bazaar. in the black slum the same stone seem to be use over and over again for house build. wheel conveyance be scarce in boondi city there be scant room for cart and the street be pave with knobsome stone unpleasant to walk over. from time to time an inroad of bunjaras pack bullock sweep the main street clear of life or one of the raja s elephant he ha twelve of them block the way. but for the most part the foot passenger have all the city for their own. 
they do not hurry themselves. they sit in the sun and think or put on all the arm in the family and hang with ironmongery parade before their admire friend. others lean dark men with bind jaw and only a tulwar for weapon dive in and out of the dark alley on errand of state. it be a beautifully lazy city do everything in the real true original native way and it be keep in very good order by the durbar. there either be or be not an order for everything. there be no order to sell fish hook or to supply an englishman with milk or to change for him currency note. he must only deal with the durbar for whatever he require. and wherever he go he must be accompany by at least two arm men. they will tell him nothing for they know or affect to know nothing of the city. they will do nothing except shout at the little innocent who joyfully run after the strange and demand pice_ but there they be and there they will stay till he leaf the city accompany him to the gate and wait there a little to see that he be fairly off and away. englishman be not encourage in boondi. the intend traveller would do well to take a full suit of political uniform with the sunflower and the little black sword to sit down upon. the local god be the agenty sahib and he be an incarnation without a name at least among the low class. the educate when speak of him always use the courtly bahadur affix. and yet it be a mean thing to gird at a state which after all be not bind to do anything for intrusive englishman without any visible mean of livelihood. the king of this fair city should declare the blockade absolute and refuse to be trouble with any one except colon nel baltah agenty sahib bahadur and the politicals. if ever a railway be run through kotah a men on the bombay side declare it must be the cloister glory of boondi will depart for kotah be only twenty mile easterly of the city and the road be moderately good. in that day the globe trotter will pry about the place and the charitable dispensary a gem among dispensary will be public property. 
the englishman be hunt for the statue of a horse a great horse hight hunja who be a steed of irak and a king s gift to rao omeda one time monarch of boondi. he find it in the city square a tod have say. and it be an unlovely statue carven after the dropsical fashion of late hindu art. no one seem to know anything about it. a little further on one cry from a byway in rusty english. come and see my dispensary. there be only two men in boondi who speak english. one be the head and the other the assistant teacher of the english side of boondi free school. the third be some twenty year ago a pupil of the lahore medical college when that institution be young. and he only remember a word here and there. he be head of the charitable dispensary. and insist upon then and there organise a small levee and pull out all his book. escape be hopeless. nothing le than a formal inspection and introduction to all the native physician would serve. there be sixteen bed in and about the courtyard and between twenty and thirty out patient stand in attendance. make allowance for untouched orientalism the dispensary be a good one and must relieve a certain amount of human misery. there be no other in all boondi. the operation book keep in english show the principal complaint of the country. they be. asthama numonia skindiseas dabalaty and loin bite. this last item occur again and again three and four case per week and it be not until the doctor say _sher se mara_ that the englishman read it aright. it be lion bite or tiger if you insist upon zoological accuracy. there be one incorrigible idiot a handsome young man naked a the day who sit in the sunshine shiver and press his hand to his head. i have give him blister and seton have try native and english treatment for two year but it be no use. he be always a you see him and now he stay here by the favour of the durbar which be a very good and pitiful durbar say the doctor. there be many such pensioner of the durbar men afflict with chronic asthama who stay by favour and be kindly treat. they be rest in the sunshine their hand on their knee sure that their daily dole of grain and tobacco and opium would be forthcoming. all folk even little child eat opium here say the doctor and the diet book prove it. after laborious investigation of everything down to the last indent to bombay for europe medicine the englishman be suffer to depart. sir i thank. begin the native doctor but the rest of the sentence stick. sixteen year in boondi doe not increase knowledge of english. and he go back to his patient gravely con over the name of the principal of the lahore medical school a college now who have teach him all he know and to whom he intend to write. there be something pathetic in the man s catch at news from the outside world of men he have know a assistant and house surgeon who be now rai bahadurs and his parade of the few shred of english that still cling to him. may he treat loin bite and catrack successfully for many year. in the happy indolent fashion that must have merit which we cannot understand he be do a good work and the durbar allow his dispensary a much a it want. 
close to the dispensary stand the free school and thither an importunate munshi steer the englishman who by this time be begin to persuade herself that he really be an accredit agent of government send to report on the progress of boondi. from a peepul shade courtyard come a clamour of young voice. thirty or forty little one from five to eight year old be sit in an open verandah learn account and hindustani say the teacher. no need to ask from what caste they come for it be write on their face that they be mahajans oswals aggerwals and in one or two case it seem sharawaks of guzerat. they be learn the business of their life and in time would take their father s place and show in how many way money might be manipulate. here the profession type come out with startle distinctness. through the chubbiness of almost babyhood or the delicate suppleness of mature year in mouth and eye and hand it betray itself. the rahtor who come of a fight stock be a fine animal and well breed. the hara who seem to be more compactly build be also a fine animal. but for a race that show blood in every line of their frame from the arch of the instep to the model of the head the financial trade be too coarse a word the financial class of rajputana appear to be the most remarkable. late in life may become cloud with fat jowl and paunch. but in his youth his quick eye nimble youth the young marwar to give him his business title be really a thing of beauty. his manner be courtly. the bare grind and a few slate suffice for the child who be merely learn the rope that drag state. but the english class of boy from ten to twelve be supply with real bench and form and a table with a cloth top. the assistant teacher for the head be on leave be a self teach man of boondi young and delicate look who prefer read to speak english. his youngster be supply with the third english read book and be painfully thumb their way through a doggerel poem about an old man with hoary hair. one boy bold than the rest sling an english sentence at the visitor and collapse. it be his little stock in trade and the rest regard him enviously. the durbar support the school which be entirely free and open. a just distinction be maintain between the various caste. the old race prejudice against payment for knowledge come out in reply to a question. you must not sell teach say the teacher. and the class murmur applausively you must not sell teach. 
the population of boondi seem more obviously mix than that of the other state. there be four or five thousand mahometans within it wall and a sprinkle of aborigine of various variety besides the human raffle that the bunjaras bring in their train with pathan and sleek delhi men. the new heraldry of the state be curious something after this sort. or_ a demi god sable_ issuant of flame hold in right hand a sword and in the leave a bow all proper. in chief a dagger of the second_ sheathe vert_ fessewise over seven arrow in sheaf of the second. this latter blazon boondi hold in commemoration of the defeat of an imperial prince who rebel against the delhi throne in the day of jehangir when boondi for value receive take service under the mahometan. it might also be but here there be no certainty the memorial of rao rutton s victory over prince khoorm when the latter strive to raise all rajputana against jehangir his father. or of a second victory over a riotous lordling who harry mewar a little late. for this exploit the annals say jehangir give rao rutton honorary flag and kettle drum which may have be melt down by the science of the herald college into the blazon aforesaid. all the heraldry of rajputana be curious and to such a hold that there be any worth in the royal science interest. udaipur s shield be naturally gules_ a sun in splendour a befit the child of the sun and fire and one of the most ancient house in india. her crest be the straight rajput sword the khanda_ for an account of the worship of which very powerful divinity read tod. the supporter be a bhil and a rajput attire for the forlorn hope. commemorate not only the defence of chitor but also the connection of the great bappa rawul with the bhils who even now play the principal part in the crown mark of a rana of udaipur. here again tod explain the matter at length. banswara claim alliance with udaipur and carry a sun with a label of difference of some kind. jeypore ha the five colour flag of amber with a sun because the house claim descent from rama and her crest be a kuchnar tree which be the bear of dasaratha father of rama. the white horse which face the tiger a supporter may or may not be memorial of the great aswamedha yuga_ or horse sacrifice that jey singh who build jeypore do not carry out. 
jodhpur ha the five colour flag with a falcon in which shape durga the patron goddess of the state ha be sometimes good enough to appear. she ha perch in the form of a wagtail on the howdah of the chief of jeysulmir whose shield be blazon with fort in a desert land and a naked leave arm hold a break spear because the legend go jeysulmir be once gall by a horse with a magic spear. they tell the story to day but it be a long one. the supporter of the shield this be cant heraldry with a vengeance. be antelope of the desert spangle with gold coin because the state be long the refuge of the wealthy banker of india. 
bikanir a young house of jodhpur carry three white hawk on the five colour flag. the patron goddess of bikanir once turn the thorny jungle round the city to fruit tree and the crest therefore be a green tree strange emblem for a desert principality. the motto however be a good one. when the great part of the rajput state be vassal of akbar and he send them abroad to do his will certain prince object to cross the indus and ask bikanir to head the mutiny because his state be the least accessible. he consent on condition that they would all for one day greet him thus. _jey jangal dar badshah. history show what become of the objector and bikanir s motto. hail to the king of the waste. prof that the tale must be true. but from boondi to bikanir be a long digression breed by idleness on the bund of the burra. it would have be sinful not to let down a line into those crowd water and the guard who be mahometans say that if the sahib do not eat fish they do. and the sahib fish luxuriously catch two and three pounder of a perch like build whenever he choose to cast. he be weary of school and dispensary and the futility of heraldry accord well with sloth that be to say boondi. 
it should be note none the le that in this part of the world the sober mind will believe anything believe in the ghost by the gau mukh and the dead thakurs who get out of their tomb and ride round the burra talao at boondi will credit every legend and lie that rise a naturally a the red flush of sunset to gild the dead glory of rajasthan. 
xvii. 
show that there may be poetry in a bank and attempt to show the wonder of the palace of boondi. 
this be a devil s place you have come to sahib. no grass for the horse and the people don t understand anything and their dirty pice be no good in nasirabad. look here. ram baksh wrathfully exhibit a handful of lump of copper. the nuisance of take a native out of his own beat be that he forthwith regard you not only a the author of his be but of all his misfortune a well. he be a hamper a a frighten child and a irritate a a man. padre martum sahib never come here say ram baksh with an air of one who have be lead against his will into bad company. 
a story about a rat that find a piece of turmeric and set up a bunnia s shop have send the one eye munshi away but a company of less munshis_ runner and the like be in attendance and they say that money might be change at the treasury which be in the palace. it be quite impossible to change it anywhere else there be no order. from the sukh mahal to the palace the road run through the heart of the city and by reason of the continual shout of the munshis_ not more than ten thousand of the fifty thousand people of boondi know for what purpose the sahib be journey through their midst. cataract be the most prevalent affliction cataract in it bad form and it be therefore necessary that men should come very close to look at the strange. they be in no sense rude but they star devoutly. he ha not come for shikar_ and he will not take petition. he ha come to see the place and god know what he be. the description be quite correct a far a it go. but somehow or another when shout out at four crossway in the midst of a very pleasant little gather it do not seem to add to dignity or command respect. 
it ha be write the coup d oeil of the castellated palace of boondi from whichever side you approach it be perhaps the most strike in india. whoever ha see the palace of boondi can easily picture to himself the hang garden of semiramis. this be true and more too. to give on paper any adequate idea of the boondi ki mahal be impossible. jeypore palace may be call the versailles of india. udaipur s house of state be dwarf by the hill round it and the spread of the pichola lake. jodhpur s house of strife grey tower on red rock be the work of giant but the palace of boondi even in broad daylight be such a palace a men build for themselves in uneasy dream the work of goblin more than of men. it be build into and out of the hillside in gigantic terrace on terrace and dominate the whole of the city. but a detail description of it be useless. owe to the dip of the valley in which the city stand it can only be well see from one place the main road of the city. and from that point look like an avalanche of masonry ready to rush down and block the gorge. like all the other palace of rajputana it be the work of many hand and the present raja ha throw out a bastion of no small size on one of the low level which ha be four or five year in the build. no one know where the hill begin and where the palace end. men say that there be subterranean chamber lead into the heart of the hill and passage communicate with the extreme limit of taragarh the giant fortress that crown the hill and flank the whole of the valley on the palace side. they say that there be a much room under a above grind and that none have traverse the whole extent of the palace. look at it from below the englishman could readily believe that nothing be impossible for those who have build it. the dominant impression be of height height that heave itself out of the hillside and weigh upon the eyelid of the beholder. the steep slope of the land have help the builder in secure this effect. from the main road of the city a steep stone pave ascent lead to the first gate name not communicate by the zealous follow. two gaudily paint fish face each other over the arch and there be little except glare colour ornamentation visible. this gate give into what they call the chowk of the palace and one have need to look twice ere realise that this open space cram with human life be a spur of the hill on which the palace stand pave and build over. there have be little attempt at level the grind. the foot wear stone follow the contour of the grind and run up to the wall of the palace smooth a glass. immediately face the gate of the fish be the quarter guard barrack a dark and dirty room and here in a chamber hollow out in a wall be store the big drum of state the nakarras. the appearance of the englishman seem to be the signal for smite the big of all and the dull thunder roll up the palace chowk_ and come back from the unpierced palace wall in hollow groan. it be an eerie welcome this single sullen boom. in this enclosure four hundred year ago if the legend be true a son of the great rao bando who dream a dream a pharaoh do and save boondi from famine leave a little band of haras to wait his bid while he go up into the palace and slew his two uncle who have usurp the throne and abandon the faith of their father. when he have pierce one and hack the other a they sit alone and unattended he call out to his follower who make a slaughter house of the enclosure and cut up the usurper adherent. at the best of time men slip on these smooth stone. and when the place be swim in blood foothold must have be treacherous indeed. 
an inquiry for the place of the murder of the uncle it be mark by a staircase slab or tod the accurate be at fault be meet by the answer that the treasury be close at hand. they speak a pagan tongue in boondi swallow half their word and adulterate the remainder with local patois. what can be extract from a people who call four mile variously do kosh_ do kush_ dhi hkas_ doo a koth_ and diakast all one word. the country folk be quite unintelligible. which simplify matter. it be the catch of a shadow of a mean here and there the hunt for direction cloak in dialect that be annoy. forego his arch√¶ological research the englishman seek the treasury. he take careful note. he even make a very bad draw but the treasury of boondi defy pin down before the public. there be a gash in the brown flank of the palace and this gash be fill with people. a break bee comb with the whole hive busily at work on repair will give a very fair idea of this extraordinary place the heart of boondi. the sunlight be very vivid without and the shadow be heavy within so that little could be see except this cling mass of humanity wriggle like maggot in a carcass. a stone staircase run up to a rough verandah build out of the wall and in the wall be a cave like room the guardian of whose depth be one of the refine financial class a man with very small hand and soft low voice. he be gird with a sword and hold authority over the durbar fund. he refer the englishman courteously to another branch of the department to find which necessitate a blunder progress up another narrow staircase crowd with lounger of all kind. here everything shine from constant contact of bare foot and hurry bare shoulder. the staircase be the thing that see from without have produce the bee comb impression. at the top be a long verandah shade from the sun and here the boondi treasury work under the guidance of a grey haired old man whose sword lay by the side of his comfortably wad cushion. he control twenty or thirty writer each wrap round a huge country paper account book and each far too busy to raise his eye. 
the babble on the staircase might have be the noise of the sea so far a these men be concern. it ebb and flow in regular beat and spread out far into the courtyard below. now and again the click click click of a scabbard tip be drag against the wall cut the dead sound of tramp naked foot and a soldier would stumble up the narrow way into the sunlight. he be receive and send back or forward by a knot of keen eye lounger who seem to act a a buff between the peace of the secretariat and the pandemonium of the administrative. saises and grass cutter mahout of elephant broker mahajuns villager from the district and here and there a shock head aborigine swell the mob on and at the foot of the stair. a they come up they meet the buff men who speak in low voice and appear to filter them accord to their merit. some be send to the far end of the verandah where everything melt away in a fresh crowd of dark face. others be send back and join the detachment shuffle for their shoe in the chowk. one servant of the palace withdraw himself to the open underneath the verandah and there sit yap from time to time like a hungry dog. the grass. the grass. the grass. but the men with the account book never stir. and they bow their head gravely and make entry or erasure turn back the rustle leaf. not often doe a reach of the river of life so present itself that it can without alteration be transfer to canvas. but the treasury of boondi the view up the long verandah stand complete and ready for any artist who care to make it his own. and by that light and le malicious irony of fate who be always give nut to those who have no teeth the picture be clinch and bring together by a wink brass hookah bowl of quaint design pitch carelessly upon a roll of dull red cloth in the foreground. the face of the accountant be of pale gold for they be an untanned breed and the face of the old man their controller be frost silver. 
it be a strange treasury but no other could have suit the palace. the englishman watch open mouth blame himself because he could not catch the mean of the order give to the fly chaprassies nor make anything of the hum in the verandah and the tumult on the stair. the old man take the commonplace currency note and announce his willingness to give change in silver. we have no small note here he say. they be not want. in a little while when you next bring the honour of your presence this way you shall find the silver. 
the englishman be take down the step and fell into the arm of a bristly giant who have leave his horse in the courtyard and the giant speak at length wave his arm in the air but the englishman could not understand him and drop into the hubbub at the palace foot. except the main line of the build there be nothing straight or angular about it. the rush of people seem to have round and soften every corner a a river grind down boulder. from the low tier two zigzag all of round stone sink in mortar take the englishman to a gate where two carve elephant be thrust at each other over the arch. and because neither he nor any one round him could give the gate a name he call it the gate of the elephant. here the noise from the treasury be soften and entry through the gate bring him into a well know world the drowsy peace of a king s palace. there be a courtyard surround by stable in which be keep choose horse and two or three groom be sleep in the sun. there be no other life except the whir and coo of the pigeon. in time though there really be no such a thing a time off the line of railway an official appear begirt with the skewer like key that open the native bayonet lock each from six inch to a foot long. where be the raj mahal in which sixty six year ago tod formally instal ram singh who be now in his eleventh year fair and with a lively intelligent cast of face. the warden make no answer but lead to a room overlook the courtyard in which two arm men stand before an empty throne of white marble. they motion silently that none must pas immediately before the seat of the king but go round keep to the far side of the double row of pillar. near the wall be stone slab pierce to take the butt of long venomous black bamboo lance. rude coffer be dispose about the room and rude sketch of ganesh adorn the wall. the men say the warden watch here day and night because this place be the rutton daulat. that you will concede be lucid enough. he who doe not understand it may go to for a thick head barbarian. 
from the rutton daulat the warden unlock door that lead into a hall of audience the chutter mahal build by raja chutter lal who be kill more than two hundred year ago in the latter day of shah jehan for whom he fight. two room each support on double row of pillar flank the open space in the centre of which be a marble reservoir. here the englishman look anxiously for some of the atrocity of the west and be please to find that with the exception of a vase of artificial flower and a clock there be nothing that jar with the exquisite pillar and the raw blaze of colour in the roof of the room. in the middle of these impertinent observation something sigh sigh like a distress ghost. unaccountable voice be at all time unpleasant especially when the hearer be some hundred foot or so above grind in an unknown palace in an unknown land. a gust of wind have find it way through one of the latticed balcony and have breathe upon a thin plate of metal some astrological instrument sling gongwise on a tripod. the tone be a soft a that of an √¶olian harp and because of the surround infinitely more plaintive. 
there be an inlay ivory door set in lintel and post crust with look glass all apparently old work. this open into a darken room where there be gild and silver charpoys and portrait in the native fashion of the illustrious dead of boondi. beyond the darkness be a balcony cling to the sheer side of the palace and it be then that the englishman realise to what a height he have climb without know it. he look down upon the bustle of the treasury and the stream of life flow into and out of the gate of the fish where the big drum lie. lift his eye he saw how boondi city have build itself spread from west to east a the confine valley become too narrow and the year more peaceable. the boondi hill be the barrier that separate the stony uneven grind near deoli from the flat of kotah twenty mile away. from the palace balcony the road to the eye be clear to the bank of the chumbul river which be the debatable ford in time go by and be leap a all river with any pretension to a pedigree have be by more than one magic horse. northward and easterly the hill run out to indurgarh and southward and westerly to territory mark dispute on the map in the present year of grace. from this balcony the raja can see to the limit of his territory eastward his empire all under his hand. he be or the politicals err that same ram singh who be instal by tod in and for whose success in kill his first deer tod be by the queen mother of boondi bid to rejoice. to day the people of boondi say. this durbar be very old. so old that few men remember it begin for that be in our father s time. it be relate also of boondi that on the occasion of the queen s jubilee they say proudly that their ruler have reign for sixty year and he be a man. they saw nothing astonish in the fact of a woman have reign for fifty. history doe not say whether they jubilate. for there be no englishman in boondi to write account of demonstration and foundation stone lay to the daily newspaper and boondi be very very small. in the early morning you may see a man pantingly chase out of the city by another man with a naked sword. this be the mail and the mail guard. and the effect be a though runner and swordsman lay under a doom the one to fly with the fear of death always before him a men fly in dream and the other to perpetually fail of his revenge. 
the warden unlock more door and lead the englishman still high but into a garden a heavily timbered garden with a tank for gold fish in the midst. for once the impassive follow smile when they saw that the englishman be impress. 
this say they be the ring bilas. but who make it. who know. it be make long ago. the englishman look over the garden wall a foot high parapet and shudder. there be only the flat side of the palace and a drop on to the stone of the zigzag score of foot below. above him be the rive hillside and the decay wall of taragarh and behind him this fair garden hang like mahomet s coffin but full of the noise of bird and the talk of the wind in the branch. the warden enter into a lengthy explanation of the nature of the delusion show how but he be stop before he be finish. his listener do not want to know how the trick be do. here be the garden and there be three or four storey climb to reach it. at one end of the garden be a small room under treatment by native artist who be paint the panel with historical picture in distemper. theirs be florid polychromatic art but skirt the floor be a series of fresco in red black and white of combat with elephant bold and temperate a good german work. they be wear and deface in place. but the hand of some bygone limner who do not know how to waste a line show under the bruise and scratch and put the new work to shame. 
here the tour of the palace end. and it must be remember that the englishman have not go the depth of three room into one flank. acre of build lay to the right of him and above the line of the terrace he could see the top of green tree. who know how many garden such a the ring bilas be to be find in the palace. no one answer directly but all say that there be many. the warden gather up his key and lock each door behind him a he pass lead the way down to earth. but before he have cross the garden the englishman hear deep down in the bowel of the palace a woman s voice sing and the voice ring a do voice in cave. all palace in india except dead one such a that of amber be full of eye. in some a ha be say the idea of be watch be strong than in others. in boondi palace it be overpower be far bad than in the green shutter corridor of jodhpur. there be trap door on the top of terrace and window veil in foliage and bull s eye set low in unexpected wall and many other peep hole and place of vantage. in the end the englishman look devoutly at the floor but when the voice of the woman come up from under his foot he felt that there be nothing leave for him but to go. yet except only this voice there be deep silence everywhere and nothing could be see. 
the warden return to the chutter mahal to pick up a lose key. the brass table of the planet be sigh softly to itself a it swing to and fro in the wind. that be the last view of the interior of the palace the empty court and the swing sigh astrolabe. 
about two hour afterwards when he have reach the other side of the valley and see the full extent of the building the englishman begin to realise first that he have not be take through one tenth of the palace. and secondly that he would do well to measure it extent by acre in preference to mean measure. but what make him blush hotly all alone among the tomb on the hillside be the idea that he with his ridiculous demand for egg firewood and sweet drink water should have clatter and chatter through any part of it at all. 
he begin to understand why boondi doe not encourage englishman. 
xviii. 
of the uncivilised night and the departure to thing civilise. show how a friend may keep an appointment too well. 
let u go hence my song she will not hear. let u go hence together without fear. but ram baksh the irrepressible sing it in altogether a base key. he come by night to the pavilion on the lake while the sepoys be cook their fish and reiterate his whine about the devildom of the country into which the englishman have drag him. padre martum sahib would never have thus treat the owner of sixteen horse all fast and big one and eight superior shutin tonga. let u get away say ram baksh. you be not here for shikar_ and the water be very bad. it be indeed except when take from the lake and then it only taste fishy. we will go ram baksh say the englishman. we will go in the very early morning and in the meantime here be fish to stay your stomach with. 
when a transparent piece of canvas which fail by three foot to reach ceiling or floor be the only bar between the east and the west he would be a churl indeed who stand upon invidious race distinction. the englishman go out and fraternise with the military the four rupee soldier of boondi who guard him. they be arm one with an old tower musket crazy a to nipple and hammer one with a native make smooth bore and one with a composite contrivance english sport muzzle loader stock with a compartment for a joint clean rod and hammer octagonal native barrel wire fasten a tuft of cotton on the foresight. all three gun be load and the owner be very proud of them. they be simple folk these men at arm with an inordinate appetite for broil fish. they be not always soldier they explain. they cultivate their crop until call for any duty that might turn up. they be pay now and again at interval but they be pay in coin and not in kind. 
the munshis and the vakils and the runner have depart after see that the englishman be safe for the night so the freedom of the little gather on the bund be unrestrained. the chowkidar come out of his cave into the firelight. he take a fish and incontinently choke for he be a feeble old man. set right again he launch into a very long and quite unintelligible story while the sepoys say reverently. he be an old man and remember many thing. a he babble the night shut in upon the lake and the valley of boondi. the last cow be drive into the water for their even drink the waterfowl and the monkey go to bed and the star come out and make a new firmament in the untroubled bosom of the lake. the light of the fire show the rule line of the bund spring out of the soft darkness of the wooded hill on the leave and disappear into the solid darkness of a bare hill on the right. below the bund a man cry aloud to keep wander pig from the garden whose tree top rise to a level with the bund edge. beyond the tree all be swaddle in gloom. when the gentle buzz of the unseen city die out it seem a though the bund be the very swordwide bridge that run a every one know between this world and the next. the water lap and mutter and now and again a fish jump with the shatter of break glass blur the peace of the reflect heaven. 
and dull should i be than some fat weed that roll itself at ease on lethe s wharf. 
the poet who write those line know nothing whatever of lethe s wharf. the englishman have find it and it seem to him at that hour and in that place that it would be good and desirable never to return to the commissioner and the deputy commissioner any more but to lie at ease on the warm sunlit bund by day and at night near a shadow breed fire to listen for the strangle voice and whisper of the darkness in the hill. thus after a long a life a the chowkidar s_ die easily and pleasantly and be bury in a red tomb on the border of the lake. surely no one would come to reclaim him across those weary weary mile of rock strew road. and this say the chowkidar_ raise his voice to enforce attention be true talk. everybody know it and now the sahib know it. i be an old man. he fell asleep at once with his head on the clay pipe that be do duty for a whole huqa among the company. he have be talk for nearly a quarter of an hour. 
see how great a man be the true novelist. six or seven thousand mile away walter besant of the golden pen have create mr. maliphant the ancient of figure head in the all sort and condition of men_ and here in boondi the englishman have find mr. maliphant in the wither flesh. so he drink walter besant s health in the water of the burra talao. one of the sepoys turn himself round with a clatter of accoutrement shift his blanket under his elbow and tell a tale. it have something to do with his khet_ and a gunna which certainly be not sugar cane. it be elusive. at time it seem that it be a woman then change to a right of way and lastly appear to be a tax. but the more he attempt to get at it mean through the curious patois in which it do or it merit be envelop the more daze the englishman become. none the le the story be a fine one embellish with much dramatic gesture which tell powerfully against the firelight. then the second sepoy who have be enjoy the pipe all the time tell a tale the purport of which be that the dead in the tomb round the lake be wont to get up of night and go hunt. this be a fine and ghostly story. and it dismal effect be much heighten by some clamour of the night far up the lake beyond the floor of star. 
the third sepoy say nothing. he have eat too much fish and be fast asleep by the side of the chowkidar. 
they be all mahometans and consequently all easy to deal with. a hindu be an excellent person but. but. there be no know what be in his heart and he be hedge about with so many strange observance. 
this hindu or musalman bend which each englishman s mind must take before he ha be three year in the country be of course influence by province or presidency. in rajputana generally the political swear by the hindu and hold that the mahometan be untrustworthy. but a man who will eat with you and take your tobacco sink the fiction that it ha be doctor with infidel wine cannot be very bad after all. 
that night when the tale be all tell and the guard bless them be snore peaceably in the starlight a man come stealthily into the enclosure of canvas and wake the englishman mutter sahib sahib in his ear. it be no robber but some poor devil with a petition a grimy welt paper. he be absolutely unintelligible and stammer almost to dumbness. he stand by the bed alternately bow to the earth and stand erect his arm spread aloft and his whole body work a he try to force out some rebellious word in a key that should not wake the men without. what could the englishman do. he be no government servant and have no concern with petition. the man click and choke and gasp in his desperate desire to make the sahib understand. but it be no use. and in the end he depart a he have come bow abject and unintelligible. 
* * * * *. 
let every word write against ganesh be rescind. it be by his order that the englishman saw such a dawn on the burra talao a he have never before set eye on. every fair morning be a reprint blur perhaps of the first day. but this splendour be a thing to be put aside from all other day and remember. the star have no fire in them and the fish have stop jump when the black water of the lake pal and grow grey. while he watch it seem to the englishman that voice on the hill be intone the first verse of genesis. the grey light move on the face of the water till with no interval a blood red glare shoot up from the horizon and inky black against the intense red a giant crane float out towards the sun. in the still shadow city the great palace drum boom and throb to show that the gate be open while the dawn sweep up the valley and make all thing clear. the blind man who say the blast of a trumpet be red speak only the truth. the break of the red dawn be like the blast of a trumpet. 
what say the chowkidar_ pick the ash of the overnight fire out of his beard what i say be five egg or twelve egg to such a raj a ours. what also be fowl what be. there be no talk of fowl. where be the fowl man from whom you get the egg. he be here. no he be there. i do not know. i be an old man and i and the raj supply everything without price. the fowl man will be pay by the state liberally pay. let the sahib be happy. wah. wah. 
experience of force labour in himalayan village have make the englishman very tender in raise supply that be give gratis. but the fowl man could not be find and the value of his ware be late pay to ganesh ganesh of situr for that be the name of the village full of priest through which the englishman have pass in ignorance two day before. a double handful of sweet smell flower make the receipt. 
boondi be wide awake before half past seven in the morning. her hunter on foot and on horse be file towards the deoli gate. they would hunt tiger and deer they say even with matchlock and muzzle loader a uncouth a those the sahib saw. they be a merry company and chaff the quarter guard at the gate unmercifully when a bullock cart lade with the case of the batoum naphtha and oil company block the road. one of them have be a soldier of the queen and excite by the appearance of a sahib do so rebuke and badger the quarter guard for their slovenliness that they threaten to come out of the barrack and destroy him. 
so after one last look at the palace high up the hillside the englishman be bear away along the deoli road. the peculiarity of boondi be the peculiarity of the cover pitfall. one doe not see it till one fall into it. a quarter of a mile from the gate town and palace be invisible. but the englishman be grieve at heart. he have fall in love with boondi the beautiful and believe that he would never again see anything half so fair. the utter untouchedness of the town be one half the charm and it association the other. read tod who be far too good to be chip or sample. read tod luxuriously on the bund of the burra talao and the spirit of the place will enter into you and you will be happy. 
to enjoy life thoroughly haste and bustle must be abandon. ram baksh ha say that englishman be always bother to go forward and for this reason though beyond doubt they pay well and readily be not wise men. he give utterance to this philosophy after he have mistake his road and pull up in what must have be a disused quarry hard by a cane field. there be patch and pocket of cultivation along the rocky road where men grow cotton chilli tobacco and sugar cane. i will get you sugar cane say ram baksh. then we will go forward and perhaps some of these jungly fool will tell u where the road be. a jungly fool a tender of goat do in time appear but there be no hurry. the sugar cane be sweet and purple and the sun warm. 
the englishman lay out at high noon on the crest of a roll upland crown with rock and hear a a loafer have tell him he would hear the set of the day which be a easily discernible a the change of tone between the rise and the fall tide. at a certain hour the impetus of the morning dy out and all thing live and inanimate turn their thought to the prophecy of the come night. the little wander breeze drop for a time and when they blow afresh bring the message. the set of the day a the loafer say ha change the machinery be begin to run down the unseen tide of the air be fall. this moment of change can only be felt in the open and in touch with the earth and once discover seem to place the finder in deep accord and fellowship with all thing on earth. perhaps this be why the genuine loafer though frequently drink be always polite to the strange and show such a genial tolerance towards the weakness of mankind black white or brown. 
in the even when the jackal be scuttle across the road and the crane have go to roost come deoli the desolate and an unpleasant meet. six day away from his kind have breed in a cockney heart a great desire to see a fellow subject. an elaborate loaf through the cantonment fifteen minute walk from end to end show only one distant dog cart and a small english child with an ayah. there be grass in the soldierly straight road and some of the cross cut have never be use at all since the day when the cantonment have be first lay out. in the western corner lay the cemetery the only carefully tend and newly whitewash thing in this god forget place. some year ago a man have say good by to the englishman. add cheerily. we shall meet again. the world s a very little place y know. 
his prophecy be a true one for the two meet indeed but the prophet be lie in deoli cemetery near the well which be decorate so ecclesiastically with funeral urn. 
xix. 
come back to the railway after reflection on the management of the empire. and so home again with apology to all who have read thus far. 
in the morning the tonga rattle past deoli cemetery into the open where the deoli irregular be drill. they mark the begin of civilisation and white shirt. and so they seem altogether detestable. yet another day s jolt enliven by the philosophy of ram baksh and then come nasirabad. the last pair of pony suggest serious think. they have cover eighteen mile at an average speed of eight mile an hour and be well condition little rat. a colonel sahib give me this one for a present say ram baksh flick the near one. it be his child s pony. the child be five year old. when he go away the colonel sahib say. ram baksh you be a good man. never have i see such a good man. this horse be yours. ram baksh be get a horse s work out of a child s pony. surely we in india work the land much a the colonel sahib work his son s mount. make it do child s work when so much more can be screw out of it. a native and a native state deal otherwise with horse and hold. perhaps our extreme scrupulousness in handle may be statecraft but after even a short sojourn in place which be deal with not so tenderly it seem absurd. there be state where thing be do and do without protest that would make the hair of the educate native stand on end with horror. these thing be of course not expedient to write. because their publication would give a great deal of unnecessary pain and heart search to estimable native administrator who have the hope of a star before their eye and would not good matter in the least. 
note this fact though. with the exception of such journal a occupy a central position in british territory levy blackmail from the neighbour state there be no independent paper in rajputana. a king may start a weekly to encourage a taste for sanskrit and high hindi or a prince may create a court chronicle. but that be all. a free press be not allow and this the native journalist know. with good management he can keep under the shadow of our flag raise two hundred rupee from a big man here and five hundred from a rich man there but he doe not establish himself across the border. to one who ha reason to hold a stubborn disbelief in even the elementary morality of the native press this bashfulness and lack of enterprise be amuse. but to return to the native state administration. there be nothing exactly wrong in the method of government that be overlay with english term and form. they be vigorous in certain point. and where they be not vigorous there be a cheery happy go luckiness about the arrangement that must be see to be understand. the shift and play of a man s fortune across the border be a sudden a anything in the day of haroun al raschid of bless memory and there be story to be get for the unearth a wild and a improbable a those in the thousand and one night. most impressive of all be the way in which the country be use and it elasticity under pressure. in the good old day the durbar raise everything it could from the people and the king spend a much a ever he could on his personal pleasure. now the institution of the political agent ha stop the grab for which by the way some of the monarch be not in the least grateful and smooth the outward face of thing. but there be still a difference between our way and the way of the other place. a year spend among native state ought to send a man back to the decency and the law court and the right of the subject with a supreme contempt for those who rave about the oppression of our brutal bureaucracy. one month nearly teach an average englishman that it be the proper thing to smite anybody of mean aspect and obstructive tendency on the mouth with a shoe. hear what an intelligent loafer say. his word be at least a valuable a these babbling. he be a usual wonderfully drink and the gift of speech come upon him. the conversation he be a great politician this loafer have turn on the poverty of india. poor. say he. of course it s poor. oh yes d d poor. and i m poor an you re poor altogether. do you expect people will give you money without you ask em. no i tell you sir there s enough money in india to pave hell with if you could only get at it. i ve kep servant in my day. do they ever leave me without a hundred or a hundred and fifty rupee put by and never touch. you mark that. doe any black man who have be in guv ment service go away without hundred an hundred put by and never touch. you mark that. money. the place stink o money just keep out o sight. do you ever know a native that didn t say garib admi. i m a poor man. they ve be sayin garib admi so long that the guv ment learn to believe em and now they re all bein treat a though they be pauper. i m a pauper an you re a pauper we aven t get anything hide in the grind an so s every white man in this forsake country. but the injian he s a rich man. how do i know. because i ve tramp on foot or warrant pretty well from one end of the place to the other an i know what i m talkin about and this ere guv ment go peckin an fiddlin over it tuppenny ha penny little tax a if it be afraid. which it be. you see how they do thing in. it s six sowars here and ten sowars there and pay up you brute or we ll pull your ear over your head. and when they ve take all they can get the headman he say. this be a dash poor yield. i ll come again. of course the people dig up something out of the grind and they pay. i know the way it s do and that s the way to do it. you can t go to an injian an say. look here. can you pay me five rupee. he say. garib admi_ of course an would say it if he be a rich a banker. but if you send half a dozen sword at him and shift the thatch off of his roof he ll pay. guv ment can t do that. i don t suppose it could. there be no reason why it shouldn t. but it might do something like it to show that it wasn t go to have no nonsense. why i d undertake to raise a hundred million what be i talk of. a hundred and fifty million pound from this country per annum_ and it wouldn t be strain then. one hundred and fifty million you could raise a easy a paint if you just make these ere injians understand that they have to pay an make no bone about it. it s enough to make a man sick to go in over yonder to and see what they do. and then come back an see what we do. perfectly sickenin it be. borrer money. why the country could pay herself an everything she want if she be only make to do it. it s this blooomin garib admi swindle that s be go on all these year that ha make fool o the guv ment. 
then he become egotistical this rag ruffian who conceive that he know the road to illimitable wealth and tell the story of his life intersperse with anecdote that would blister the paper they be write on. but through all his raving he stick to his hundred and fifty million theory and though the listener dissent from him and the brutal cruelty with which his view be state an unscientific impression remain not to be shake off. across the border one feel that the country be be use exploit make to sit up so to speak. in our territory the feel be equally strong of wealth just round the corner a the loafer say of a people wrap up in cotton wool and ungetatable. will any man who really know something of a little piece of india and ha not the fear of run counter to custom before his eye explain how this impression be produce and why it be an erroneous one. 
nasirabad mark the end of the englishman s holiday and there be sorrow in his heart. come back again say ram baksh cheerfully and bring a gun with you. then i ll take you to gungra and i ll drive you myself. drive you just a well a i ve drive these four day past. an amicable open mind soul be ram baksh. may his tonga never grow le.

this ere burma fever be a bad thing to have. it s pull me down awful. an now i be go to peshawar. be you the station master. it be thomas white cheek sink eye draw mouth thomas travel from nasirabad to peshawar on pas. and with him be a corporal new to his stripe and do station duty. every thomas be interest except when he be too drink to speak. this thomas be an enthusiast. he have volunteer from a home go regiment shatter by burma fever into a regiment at peshawar have break down at nasirabad on his way up with his draft and be now journey into the unknown to pick up another medal. there s sure to be something on the frontier say this gaunt haggard boy he be little more though he reckon four year service and consider himself somebody. when there s anything go peshawar s the place to be in they tell me. but i hear we shall have to march down to calcutta in no time. the corporal be a little man and show his friend off with great pride. ah you should have come to us_ say he. we re the regiment we be. well i go with the rest of our men say thomas. there s three hundred of u volunteer to stay on and we all go for the same regiment. not but what i m say yours be a good regiment he add with grave courtesy. this loose the corporal s tongue and he descant on the virtue of the regiment and the merit of the officer. it ha be write that thomas be devoid of esprit de corps_ because of the jerkiness of the arrangement under which he now serf. if this be true he manage to conceal his feeling very well. for he speak most fluently in praise of his own regiment. and for all his youth ha a keen appreciation of the merit of his officer. go to him when his heart be open and hear him go through the roll of the subaltern by a grade totally unknown in the army list and you will pick up something worth the hear. thomas with the burma fever on him try to cut in from time to time with story of his officer and what they have do when we be marchin all up and down burma but the little corporal go on gayly. 
they make a curious contrast these two type. the lathy town breed thomas with hock bottle shoulder a little education and a keen desire to get more medal and stripe. and the little deep chested bull neck corporal brim over with vitality and devoid of any idea beyond the regiment. and the end of both life in all likelihood would be a nameless grave in some cantonment bury grind with if the case be specially interest and the regimental doctor have a turn for the pen an obituary notice in the indian medical journal. it be an unpleasant think. 
from the army to the navy be a perfectly natural transition but one hardly to be expect in the heart of india. dawn show the railway carriage full of riotous boy for the agra and mount abu school have break up for holiday. surely it be natural enough to ask a child not a boy but a child whether he be go home for the holiday. and surely it be a crush a petrify thing to hear in a clear treble ting with icy scorn. no. i m on leave. i m a midshipman. two officer of her majesty s navy mids of a man o war at bombay be go up country on ten day leave. they have not travel much more than twice round the world. but they should have print the fact on a label. they chatter like daw and their talk be a a whiff of fresh air from the open sea while the train run eastward under the aravalis. at that hour their life be bind up in and make glorious by the hope of rid a horse when they reach their journey s end. much have they see city and men and the artless way in which they interlard their conversation with allusion to one of those shore go chap you see be delicious. they have no care no fear no servant and an unlimited stock of wonder and admiration for everything they saw from the cute little well scoop to a herd of deer graze on the horizon. it be not until they have open their young heart with infantile abandon that the listener could guess from the incidental argot where these pocket ulysses have travel. south african norwegian and arabian word be use to help out the slang of shipboard and a copious vocabulary of shipboard term complicate with modern greek. a free from self consciousness a child a ignorant a being from another planet of the anglo indian life into which they be go to dip for a few day shrewd and observant a befit men of the world who have authority and neat hand and resourceful a blue jacket they be a delightful study and accept freely and frankly the elaborate apology tender to them for the unfortunate mistake about the holiday. the road divide and they go their way. and there be a shadow after they have go for the globe trotter say to his wife what i like about jeypore accent on the first syllable if you please be it characteristic easternness. and the globe trotter s wife say. yes. it be purely oriental. 
this be jeypore with the gas jet and the water pipe a be show at the begin of these trivial letter. and the globe trotter and his wife have not be to amber. joyful think. they have not see the soft splendour of udaipur the nightmare of chitor the grim power of jodhpur and the virgin beauty of boondi fair of all place that the englishman have set eye on. the globe trotter be great in the matter of hotel and food but he have not lie under the shadow of a tonga in soft warm sand eat cold pork with a pocket knife and thank providence who put sweet water stream where wayfarer want them. he have not drink out the brilliant cold weather night in the company of a king of loafer a grimy scallawag with a six day beard and an unholy knowledge of native state. he have attend service in cantonment church. but he have not know what it be to witness the simple solemn ceremonial in the din room of a far away residency when all the english folk within a hundred mile circuit bow their head before the god of the christian. he have blunder about temple of strange deity with a guide at his elbow. but he have not know what it be to attempt conversation with a temple dance girl. not such an one a edwin arnold invent. and to be reward for a misturned compliment with a deftly heave bunch of marigold bud in his respectable bosom. yet he have undoubtedly lose much and the measure of his loss be prove in his estimate of the orientalism of jeypore. 
but what have he who sit in judgment upon him gain. one perfect month of loaferdom to be remember above all others and the night of the visit to chitor to be remember even when the month be forget. also the sad knowledge that of all the fair thing see the inept pen give but a feeble and blur picture. 
let those who have read to the end pardon a hundred blemish.

march september. 
no. i. 
of freedom and the necessity of use her. the motive and the scheme that will come to nothing. a disquisition upon the otherness of thing and the torment of the damn. 
when all the world be young lad and all the tree be green and every goose a swan lad and every lass a queen then hey for boot and horse lad and o er the world away young blood must have it course lad and every dog it day. 
after seven year it please necessity whom we all serve to turn to me and say. now you need do nothing whatever. you be free to enjoy yourself. i will take the yoke of bondage from your neck for one year. what do you choose to do with my gift. and i consider the matter in several light. at first i hold notion of regenerate society. but it appear that this would demand more than a year and perhaps society would not be grateful after all. then i would fain enter upon one monumental bust. but i reflect that this at the outside could endure but three month while the headache would last for nine. then come by the person that i most hate a globe trotter. he sit in my chair discuss india with the unbridle arrogance of five week on a cook s ticket. he be from england and have drop his manner in the suez canal. i assure you say he that you who live so close to the actual fact of thing cannot form dispassionate judgment of their merit. you be too near. now i he wave his hand modestly and leave me to fill the gap. 
i consider him from his new helmet to his deck shoe and i perceive that he be but an ordinary man. i think of india malign and silent india give up to the ill consider wandering of such a he of the land whose people be too busy to reply to the libel upon their life and manner. it be my destiny to avenge india upon nothing le than three quarter of the world. the idea necessitate sacrifice painful sacrifice for i have to become a globe trotter with a helmet and deck shoe. in the interest of our little world i would endure these thing and more. i would deliver brawl judgment all day long. on all thing unashamed. i would go toward the rise sun till i reach the heart of the world and once more smelt london asphalt. 
the indian public never give me a brief. i take it appoint myself commissioner in general for our own sweet self. then all the aspect of life change a they say the appearance of his room grow strange to a die man when he see it upon the last morning and know that it will confront him no more. i have wilfully step aside from the current of our existence and have no part in any of our interest. up country the peach be begin to bud and men say that by cause of the heavy snow in the hill the hot weather would be a short one. that be nothing to me. the punkah and their puller sit together in the verandah and the public building spawn thermantidotes. the copper smith sing in the garden and the early wasp hum low down by the door handle and they prophesy of the hot weather to come. these thing be no concern of mine. i be dead and look upon the old life a a dead man without interest and without concern. 
it be a strange life. i have live it for seven year or one day i could not be certain which. all that i know be that i could watch men go to their office while i sleep luxuriously. could go out at any hour of the day and sit up to any hour of the night secure that each morning would bring no toil. i understand with what emotion the free convict regard the prison he ha quit insight which have hitherto be deny me. and i further saw how intense be the selfishness of the irresponsible man. some say that the come year would be one of scarcity and distress because unseasonable rain be fall. i be grieve. i fear that the rain might break the railway line to the sea and so delay my departure. again the season would be a sickly one. i fancy that necessity might repent of her gift and for mere jest wipe me off the face of the earth ere i have see anything of what lay upon it. there be trouble on the afghan frontier. perhaps an army corp would be mobilise and perhaps many men would die leave folk to mourn for them at the hill station. my dread be that a russian man of war might intercept the steamer which carry my precious self between yokohama and san francisco. let armageddon be postpone i pray for my sake that my personal enjoyment may not be interfere with. war famine and pestilence would be so inconvenient to me. and i abase myself before necessity the great goddess and say ostentatiously. it be naught it be naught and you needn t look at me when i wander about. surely we be only virtuous by compulsion of earn our daily bread. 
so i look upon men with new eye and pity them very much indeed. they work. they have to. i be an aristocrat. i could call upon them at inconvenient hour and ask them why they work and whether they do it often. then they grunt and the envy in their eye be a delight to me. i dare not however mock them too pointedly l necessity should drag me back by the collar to take my still warm place by their side. when i have disgust all who know me i flee to calcutta which i be pain to see still persist in be a city and transact commerce after i have formally curse it one year ago. that curse i now repeat in the hope that the unsavoury capital will collapse. one must begin to smoke at five in the morning which be neither night nor day on come across the howrah bridge for it be good to get a headache from honest nicotine than to be poison by evil smell. and a man who otherwise be a nice man though he work with his hand and his head ask me why the scandal of the simla exodus be allow to continue. to him i make answer. it be because this sewer be unfit for human habitation. it be because you be all one gigantic mistake you and your monument and your merchant and everything about you. i rejoice to think that score of lakh of rupee have be spend on public office at a place call simla that score and score will be spend on the delhi kalka line in order that civilise people may go there in comfort. when that line be open your big city will be dead and bury and do with and i hope it will teach you a lesson. your city will rot sir. and he say. when people be bury here they turn into adipocere in five day if the weather be rainy. they saponify you know. i say. go and saponify for i hate calcutta. but he take me to the eden garden instead and beg me for my own sake not to go round the world in this prejudice spirit. i be unhappy and ill but he vow that my spleen be due to my simla way of look at thing. 
all this world of ours know something about the eden garden which be suppose by the uninitiated of the mofussil to represent the gild luxury of the metropolis. a a matter of fact they be hideously dull. the inhabitant appear in top hat and frock coat and walk dolorously to and fro under the glare of jerk electric lamp when they ought to be sit in their shirt sleeve round little table and treat their wife to ice lager beer. my friend it be a muggy march night wrap himself in the prescribe garment and say graciously. you can wear a round hat but you mustn t wear deck shoe. and for goodness sake my dear fellow don t smoke on the red road all the people one know go there. most of the people who be people sit in their carriage in an atmosphere of hot horse harness and panel lacquer outside the garden and the remnant tramp up and down by two and three upon squashy green grass until they be weary while a band play at them. and be this all you do. i ask. it be say my friend. isn t it good enough. we meet every one we know here and walk with him or her unless he or she be among the carriage. 
overhead be a woolly warm sky. underfoot feverish soft grass. and from all quarter the languorous breeze bore faint reminiscence of stale sewage upon it wing. round the horizon be stack line of carriage and the electric flare breed ache in the strain eyebrow. it be a strange sight and fascinate. the doom creature walk up and down without cessation for when one flee away into the lamp spangle gloom twenty come to take his place. slop hat member of the mercantile marine armenian merchant bengal civilian shop girl and shop men jew parthian and mesopotamians be all there in the tepid heat and the fetid smell. 
this say my friend be how we enjoy ourselves. there be the viceregal livery. lady lansdowne come here. he speak a though read to me the government house list of paradise. i reflect that these people would continue to walk up and down until they die drinkless dusty sad and blanch. 
in say this last thing i have make a mistake. calcutta be no more anglo indian than west brompton. in common with bombay it ha achieve a mental attitude several decade in advance of that of the raw and brutal india of fact. an intelligent and responsible financier discuss the empire say. but why do we want so large an army in india. look at the country all about. i think he mean a far a the circular road or perhaps raneegunge. some of these day when the voice of the two uncomprehending city carry to london and it advice be act upon there will be trouble. till this second journey to calcutta i be unable to account for the acid tone and limit range of the presidency journal. i see now that they be ward paper and ought to be treat a such. 
in the fulness of time there be no hurry imagine that o you toiler of the land i take ship and flee from calcutta by that which they call the mutton mail because it take sheep and correspondence to rangoon. half the punjab be go with u to serve the queen in the burma military police and it be grateful to catch once more the raw rasp up country speech amid the jabber of burmese and bengali. 
to rangoon then aboard the madura_ come with me down the hughli and try to understand what sort of life be lead by the pilot those strange men who only seem to know the land by watch it from the river. 
and i fetch up under the north ridge with six inch o water under me with a sou west monsoon blow an me not know any more than the dead where in paradise i be take her say one deep voice. 
well what do you expect. say another. they ought not all to be occult light. give me a red with two flash for outlying danger anyhow. the hughli s the bad river in the world. why off the low gasper only last year. 
and look at the way government treat you. 
the hughli pilot be human. he may talk greek in the exercise of his profession but he can unite at swear at the government a thoroughly a though he be an uncovenanted civilian. his life be a hard one. but he be full of strange story and when treat with proper respect may condescend to tell some of them. if he ha serve on the river for six year a a cub and be neither dead nor decrepit i believe he can earn a much a fifty rupee by send two thousand ton of ship and a few hundred soul fly down the reach at twelve mile an hour. then he drop over the side with your last love letter and wander about the estuary in a tug until he find another steamer and bring her up. it doe not take much to comfort him. 
* * * * *. 
somewhere in the open sea some day late. i give it up. i cannot write and to sleep i be not ashamed. a glorious idleness ha take entire possession of me. journalism be an imposture. so be literature. so be art. all india drop out of sight yesterday and the rock pilot brig at the sandheads bore my last message to the prison that i quit. we have reach blue water crush sapphire and a little breeze be belly the awning. three fly fish be sight this morning. the tea at chota hazri be not nice but the captain be excellent. be this budget of news sufficiently excite or must i in strict confidence tell you the story of the professor and the compass. you will hear more about the professor late if indeed i ever touch pen again. when he be in india he work about nine hour a day. at noon to day he conceive an interest in cyclone and thing of that kind would go to his cabin to get a compass and a meteorological book. he go but stop to reflect by the brink of a drink. the compass be in a box say he drowsily but the nuisance of it be that to get it i shall have to pull the box out from under my berth. all thing consider i don t think it s worth while. he loaf on deck and i think by this time be fast asleep. there be no trace of shame in his voice for his mighty sloth. i would have reprove him but the word die on my tongue. i be guilty than he. 
professor say i there be a foolish little paper in allahabad call the pioneer. i be suppose to be write it a letter a letter with my hand. do you ever hear of anything so absurd. 
i wonder if angostura bitter really go with whisky say the professor toy with the neck of the bottle. 
there be no such place a india. there never be a daily paper call the pioneer. it be all a weary dream. the only real thing in the world be crystal sea clean sweep deck soft rug warm sunshine the smell of salt in the air and fathomless futile indolence. 
no. ii. 
the river of the lose footstep and the golden mystery upon it bank. the iniquity of jordan. show how a man may go to the shway dagon pagoda and see it not and to the pegu club and hear too much. a dissertation on mix drink. 
i be a part of all that i have meet yet all experience be an arch where through gleam that untravelled world whose margin fade for ever and for ever when i move. 
there be a river and a bar a pilot and a great deal of nautical mystery and the captain say the journey from calcutta be end and that we should be in rangoon in a few hour. it be not an impressive stream be low bank scrubby and muddy. but a we give the stagger rice boat the go by i reflect that i be look upon the river of the lose footstep the road that so many many men of my acquaintance have travel never to return within the past three year. such a one have go up to open out upper burma and have himself be open out by a burmese dah in the cruel scrub beyond minhla. such another have go to rule the land in the queen s name but could not rule a hill stream and be carry down under his horse. one have be shoot by his servant. another by a dacoit while he sit at dinner. and a pitifully long list have find in jungle fever their sole reward for the difficulty and privation inseparably connect with military service a the bengal army regulation put it. i run over half a score of name policeman subaltern young civilian employ√©s of big trade firm and adventurer. they have go up the river and they have die. at my elbow stand one of the worker in new burma go to report himself at rangoon and he tell tale of interminable chase after evasive dacoit of marching and counter marching that come to nothing and of death in the wilderness a noble a they be sad. 
then a golden mystery upheave itself on the horizon a beautiful wink wonder that blaze in the sun of a shape that be neither muslim dome nor hindu temple spire. it stand upon a green knoll and below it be line of warehouse shed and mill. under what new god think i be we irrepressible english sit now. 
there s the old shway dagon. pronounce dagone not like the god in the scripture. say my companion. confound it. but it be not a thing to be swear at. it explain in the first place why we take rangoon and in the second why we push on to see what more of rich or rare the land hold. up till that sight my uninstructed eye could not see that the land differ much in appearance from the sunderbuns but the golden dome say. this be burma and it will be quite unlike any land you know about. it s a famous old shrine o sort say my companion and now the tounghoo mandalay line be open pilgrim be flock down by the thousand to see it. it lose it big gold top thing that they call a htee in an earthquake. that s why it s all hide by bamboo work for a third of it height. you should see it when it s all uncover. they re regilding it now. 
why be it that when one view for the first time any of the wonder of the earth a bystander always strike in with you should see it etc. such men give twenty minute from the tomb at the day of judgment would patronize the naked soul a they hurry up with the glare of tophet on their face and say. you should have see this when gabriel first begin to blow. what the shway dagon really be and how many book may have be write upon it history and arch√¶ology be no part of my business. a it stand overlook everything it seem to explain all about burma why the boy have go north and die why the trooper bustle to and fro and why the steamer of the irrawaddy flotilla lay like black back gull upon the water. 
then we come to a new land and the first thing that one of the regular resident say be. this place isn t india at all. they ought to have make it a crown colony. judge the empire a it ought to be judge by it most prominent point videlicet_ it smell he be right. for though there be one stink in calcutta another in bombay and a third and most pungent one in the punjab yet they have a kinship of stink whereas burma smell quite otherwise. it be not exactly what china ought to smell like but it be not india. what be it. i ask. and the man say _napi_ which be fish pickle when it ought to have be bury long ago. this food in guide book language be inordinately consume by. but everybody who ha be within downwind range of rangoon know what napi mean and those who do not will not understand. 
yes it be a very new land a land where the people understand colour a delightfully lazy land full of pretty girl and very bad cheroot. 
the bad of it be that the anglo indian be a foreigner a creature of no account. he do not know burman which be no great loss and the madrassi insist upon address him in english. the madrassi by the way be a great institution. he take the place of the burman who will not work and in a few year return to his native coast with ring on his finger and bell on his toe. the consequence be obvious. the madrassi demand and receive enormous wage and get to know that he be indispensable. the burman exist beautifully while his woman folk marry the madrassi and the chinaman because these support them in affluence. when the burman wish to work he get a madrassi to do it for him. how he find the money to pay the madrassi i be not inform but all men be agree in say that under no circumstance will the burman exert himself in the path of honest industry. now if a bountiful providence have clothe you in a purple green amber or puce petticoat have throw a rise pink scarf turban over your head and have put you in a pleasant damp country where rice grow of itself and fish come up to be catch putrified and pickle would you work. would you not rather take a cheroot and loaf about the street see what be to be see. if two third of your girl be grin good humour little maiden and the remainder positively pretty would you not spend your time in make love. 
the burman doe both these thing and the englishman who after all work himself to burma say hard thing about him. personally i love the burman with the blind favouritism bear of first impression. when i die i will be a burman with twenty yard of real king s silk that ha be make in mandalay about my body and a succession of cigarette between my lip. i will wave the cigarette to emphasise my conversation which shall be full of jest and repartee and i will always walk about with a pretty almond colour girl who shall laugh and jest too a a young maiden ought. she shall not pull a sari over her head when a man look at her and glare suggestively from behind it nor shall she tramp behind me when i walk. for these be the custom of india. she shall look all the world between the eye in honesty and good fellowship and i will teach her not to defile her pretty mouth with chop tobacco in a cabbage leaf but to inhale good cigarette of egypt s best brand. 
seriously the burmese girl be very pretty and when i saw them i understand much that i have hear about about our army in flanders let u say. 
providence really help those who do not help themselves. i go up a street name unknown attract by the colour that be so wantonly flash down it length. there be colour in rajputana and in southern india and you can find a whole paletteful of raw tint at any down country durbar. but the burmese way of colour be different. with the woman the scarf petticoat and jacket be of three lively hue and with the men putso and head wrap be gorgeous. thus you get your colour dash down in dot against a background of dark timber house set in green foliage. there be no canon of art anywhere and every scheme of colour depend on the power of the sun above. that be why men in a london fog do still believe in pale green and sad red. give me lilac pink vermilion lapis lazuli and blister blood red under fierce sunlight that mellow and modify all. i have just make this discovery and be note that the people treat their cattle kindly when the driver of an absurd little hire carriage build to the scale of a fat burma pony volunteer to take me for a drive and we drive in the direction of the english quarter of the town where the sahib live in dainty little house make out of the side of cigar box. they look a if they could be kick in at a blow and. trust a globe trotter for evolve a theory at a minute s notice. it be to avoid this fate that they be build for the most part on leg. the house be not cantonment breed in any way nor do the uneven grind and dusty reddish road fit in with any part of the indian empire except it may be ootacamund. 
the pony wander into a garden stud with lovely little lake which again be stud with island and there be sahib in flannel in the boat. outside the park be pleasant little monastery full of clean shave gentleman in gold amber robe learn to renounce the world the flesh and the devil by chat furiously amongst themselves and at every corner stand the three little maid from school almost exactly a they have be dismiss from the side scene of the savoy after the mikado be over. and the strange part of it all be that every one laugh laugh so it seem at the sky above them because it be blue at the sun because it be sink and at each other because they have nothing good to do. a small fat child laugh loud of all in spite of the fact that it be smoke a cheroot that ought to have make it deathly sick. the pagoda be always close at hand a brilliant a mystery a when first sight far down the river. but it change it shape a we come near and show in the middle of a nest of hundred of small pagoda. there appear suddenly two colossal tiger. after the burmese canon. in plaster on a hillside and they be the guardian of burma s great pagoda. round them rustle a great crowd of happy people in pretty dress and the foot of all be turn towards a great stoneway that run from between the tiger even to the brow of the mound. but the nature of the stair be peculiar. they be cover in for the most part by a tunnel or it may have be a wall in colonnade for there be heavily gild wooden pillar visible in the gloom. the afternoon be draw on a i come to this strange place and saw that i should have to climb up a long low hill of stair to get to the pagoda. 
once or twice in my life i have see a globe trotter literally gasp with jealous emotion because india be so much large and more lovely than he have ever dream and because he have only set aside three month to explore it in. my own sojourn in rangoon be countable by hour so i may be forgive when i prance with impatience at the bottom of the staircase because i could not at once secure a full complete and accurate idea of everything that be to be see. the mean of the guardian tiger the inwardness of the main pagoda and the countless little one be hide from me. i could not understand why the pretty girl with cheroot sell little stick and colour candle to be use before the image of buddha. everything be incomprehensible to me and there be none to explain. all that i could gather be that in a few day the great golden htee that ha be deface by the earthquake would be hoist into position with feast and song and that half upper burma be come down to see the show. 
i go forward between the two great beast across a whitewash court till i come to a flat head arch guard by the lame the blind the leper and the deform. these pluck at my clothe a i pass and moan and whine. but the stream that disappear up the gentle slope of the stairway take no notice of them. and i step into the semi darkness of a long long corridor flank by booth and floor with stone wear very smooth by human foot. 
at the far end of the roof corridor there be a breadth of even sky and at this point rise a second and much steep flight of stair lead directly to the shwedagon. this by the way be it real spell. down this staircase fell from gloom to deep gloom a cascade of colour. at this point i stay because there be a beautiful archway of burmese build and adorn with a chinese inscription directly in front of me and i conceive foolishly that i should find nothing more pleasant to look at if i go farther. also i wish to understand how such a people could produce the dacoit of the newspaper and i know that a great deal of promiscuous knowledge come to him who sit down by the wayside. then i saw a face which explain a good deal. the chin jowl lip and neck be model faithfully on the line of the bad of the roman empress the lollop wallop woman that swinburne sing about and that we sometimes see picture of. above this gross perfection of form come the mongoloid nose narrow forehead and flare pig s eye. i star intently and the man star back again with admirable insolence that pucker one corner of his mouth. then he swagger forward and i be rich by a new face and a little knowledge. i must make further inquiry at the club say i but that man seem to be of the proper dacoit type. he could crucify on occasion. 
then a brown baby come by in it mother s arm and laugh wherefore i much desire to shake hand with it and grin to that effect. the mother hold out the tiny soft pud and laugh and the baby laugh and we all laugh together because that seem to be the custom of the country and return down the now dark corridor where the lamp of the stall keeper be twinkle and score of people be help u to laugh. they must be a mild mannered nation the burmese for they leave little three year old in charge of a whole wilderness of clay doll or a menagerie of joint tiger. 
i have not actually enter the shwedagon but i felt just a happy a though i have. 
in the pegu club i find a friend a punjabi upon whose broad bosom i throw myself and demand food and entertainment. he have not long since receive a visit from the commissioner of peshawar of all place in the world and be not to be upset by sudden arrival. but he have come down in the world hideously. year ago in the black north he use to speak the vernacular a it should be speak and be one of u. 
_daniel how many sock master get. 
the unfinished peg fell from my fist. good heaven. say i be it possible that you you speak that disgust pidgin talk to your nauker. it s enough to make one cry. you re no good than a bombaywallah. 
i m a madrassi say he calmly. we all talk english to our boy here. isn t it beautiful. now come along to the gymkhana and then we ll dine here. daniel master s hat and stick get. 
there must be a few hundred men who be fairly behind the scene of the burma war one of the least know and appreciate of any of our little affair. the pegu club seem to be full of men on their way up or down and the conversation be but an echo of the murmur of conquest far away to the north. 
see that man over there. he be cut over the head the other day at zoungloung goo. awfully tough man. that chap next him ha be on the dacoit hunt for about a year. he break up boh mango s gang. catch the boh in a paddy field y know. the other man s go home on sick leave get a lump of iron somewhere in his system. try our mutton. i assure you the club be the only place in rangoon where you get mutton. look here you must not speak vernacular to our boy. hi boy. get master some more ice. they re all bombay men or madrassis. up at the front there be some burman servant. but a real burman will never work. he prefer be a simple little daku. 
how much. 
dear little dacoit. we call em dakus for short sort o pet name. that s the butter fish. i forget you didn t get much fish up country. yes i s pose rangoon ha it advantage. you pay like a prince. take an ordinary marry establishment. little furnish house one hundred and fifty rupee. servant wage two twenty or two fifty. that s four hundred at once. my dear fellow a sweeper win t take le than twelve or sixteen rupee a month here and even then he ll work for other house. it s bad than quetta. any man who come to low burma in the hope of live on his pay be a fool. 
voice from low end of table. dee fool. it s different in upper burma where you get command and travel allowance. 
another voice in the middle of a conversation. they never get that story into the paper but i can tell you we weren t quite a quick in rush the fort a they make believe. you see boh gwee have u in a regular trap and by the time we have close the line our men be be pepper front and rear. that jungle fight be the deuce and all. more ice please. 
then they tell me of the death of an old school fellow under the ramp of the minhla redoubt doe any one remember the affair at minhla that open the third burmese ball. 
i be close to him say a voice. he die in a. s arm i fancy but i m not quite sure. anyhow i know he die easily. he be a good fellow. 
thank you say i and now i think i ll go. and i go out into the steamy night my head ring with story of battle murder and sudden death. i have reach the fringe of the veil that hide upper burma and i would have give much to have go up the river and see a score of old friend now jungle wear men of war. all that night i dream of interminable staircase down which sweep thousand of pretty girl so brilliantly rob that my eye ache at the sight. there be a great golden bell at the top of the stair and at the bottom his face turn to the sky lay poor old d dead at minhla and a host of unshaven ragamuffin in khaki be keep guard over him. 
no. iii. 
the city of elephant which be govern by the great god of idleness who life on the top of a hill. the history of three great discovery and the naughty child of iquique. 
i build my soul a lordly pleasure house wherein at ease for aye to dwell i say. oh soul make merry and carouse dear soul for all be well. 
so much for make definite programme of travel beforehand. in my first letter i tell you that i would go from rangoon to penang direct. now we be lie off moulmein in a new steamer which doe not seem to run anywhere in particular. why she should go to moulmein be a mystery. but a every soul on the ship be a loafer like myself no one be discontent. imagine a shipload of people to whom time be no object who have no desire beyond three meal a day and no emotion save those cause by a casual cockroach. 
moulmein be situate up the mouth of a river which ought to flow through south america and all manner of dissolute native craft appear to make the place their home. ugly cargo steamer that the initiate call geordie tramp grunt and bellow at the beautiful hill all round and the pot belly british india liner wallow down the reach. visitor be rare in moulmein so rare that few but cargo boat think it worth their while to come off from the shore. 
strictly in confidence i will tell you that moulmein be not a city of this earth at all. sindbad the sailor visit it if you recollect on that memorable voyage when he discover the burial grind of the elephant. 
a the steamer come up the river we be aware of first one elephant and then another hard at work in timber yard that face the shore. a few narrow mind folk with binoculars say that there be mahout upon their back but this be never clearly prove. i prefer to believe in what i saw a sleepy town just one house thick scatter along a lovely stream and inhabit by slow solemn elephant build stockade for their own diversion. there be a strong scent of freshly saw teak in the air we could not see any elephant saw and occasionally the warm stillness be break by the crash of the log. when the elephant have get an appetite for luncheon they loaf off in couple to their club and do not take the trouble to give u greet and the late mail paper. at which we be much disappoint but take heart when we saw upon a hill a large white pagoda surround by score of little pagoda. this we say with one voice be the place to make an excursion to and then shudder at our own profanity for above all thing we do not wish to behave like mere vulgar tourist. 
the ticca gharies at moulmein be three size small than those of rangoon a the pony be no big than decent sheep. their driver trot them uphill and down and a the ghari be extremely narrow and the road be anything but good the exercise be refresh. here again all the driver be madrassis. 
i should good remember what that pagoda be like have i not fall deeply and irrevocably in love with a burmese girl at the foot of the first flight of step. only the fact of the steamer start next noon prevent me from stay at moulmein forever and own a pair of elephant. these be so common that they wander about the street and i make no doubt could be obtain for a piece of sugar cane. 
leave this far too lovely maiden i go up the step only a few yard and turn me round look upon a view of water island broad river fair graze grind and belt wood that make me rejoice that i be alive. the hillside below me and above me be ablaze with pagoda from a gorgeous golden and vermilion beauty to a delicate grey stone one just complete in honour of an eminent priest lately decease at mandalay. far above my head there be a faint tinkle a of golden bell and a talk of the breeze in the top of the toddy palm. wherefore i climb high and high up the step till i reach a place of great peace dot with burmese image spotlessly clean. here woman now and again pay reverence. they bow their head and their lip move because they be pray. i have an umbrella a black one in my hand deck shoe upon my foot and a helmet upon my head. i do not pray i swear at myself for be a globe trotter and wish that i have enough burmese to explain to these lady that i be sorry and would have take off my hat but for the sun. a globe trotter be a brute. i have the grace to blush a i tramp round the pagoda. that will be remember to me for righteousness. but i star horribly at a gold and red side temple with a beautifully gild image of buddha in it at the grim figure in the niche at the base of the main pagoda at the little palm that grow out of the crack in the tile pave of the court at the big palm above and at the low hang bronze bell that stand at each corner for the woman to smite with stag horn. upon one bell ring this amaze triplet in english evidently the composition of the caster who complete his work and now let u hope ha reach nibban thirty five year ago. 
he who destroy this bell they must be in the great hel and unable to come out. 
i respect a man who be not able to spell hell properly. it show that he ha be bring up in an amiable creed. you who come to moulmein treat this bell with respect and refrain from play with it for that hurt the feeling of the worshipper. 
in the base of the pagoda be four room line a to three side with colossal plaster figure before each of whom burn one solitary dip whose ray fight with the flood of even sunshine that come through the window and the room be fill with a pale yellow light unearthly to stand in. occasionally a woman creep in to one of these room to pray but nearly all the company stay in the courtyard. but those that face the figure pray more zealously than the others so i judge that their trouble be the great. of the actual cult i know le than nothing. for the neatly bind english book that we read make no mention of point red tip straw at a golden image or of the bang of bell after the custom of worshipper in a hindu temple. it must be a genial one however. to begin with it be quiet and carry on among the fair possible surround that ever landscape offer. 
in this particular case the massive white pagoda shoot into the blue from the west of a wall hill that command four separate and desirable view a you look either at the steamer in the river below the polish silver reach to the leave the wood to the right or the roof of moulmein to the landward. between each pause of the rustle of dress and the low tone talk of the woman fell from far above the tinkle of innumerable metal leaf which be stir by the breeze a they hang from the htee of the pagoda. a golden image wink in the sun. the paint one star straight in front of them over the head of the worshipper and somewhere below a mallet and a plane be lazily help to build yet another pagoda in honour of the lord of the earth. 
sit in meditation while the professor go round with a sacrilegious camera to the vast terror of the burmese youth i make two notable discovery and nearly go to sleep over them. the first be that the lord of the earth be idleness thick slab idleness with a little religion stir in to keep it sweet and the second be that the shape of the pagoda come originally from a bulge toddy palm trunk. there be one between me and the far off sky line and it exactly duplicate the outline of a small grey stone build. 
yet a third discovery and a much more important one come to me late on. a dirty little imp of a boy run by clothe more or le in a beautifully work silk putso the like of which i have in vain attempt to secure at rangoon. a bystander tell me that such an article would cost one hundred and ten rupee exactly ten rupee in excess of the price demand at rangoon when i have be discourteous to a pretty burmese girl with diamond in her ear and have treat her a though she be a delhi boxwallah. 
professor say i when the camera spidered round the corner there be something wrong with this people. they win t work they aren t all dacoit and their baby run about with hundred rupee putsoes on them while their parent speak the truth. how in the world do they get a live. 
they exist beautifully say the professor. and i only bring half a dozen plate with me. i shall come again in the morning with some more. do i ever dream of a place like this. 
no say i. it s perfect and for the life of me i can t quite see where the precise charm lie. 
in it beastly laziness say the professor a he pack the camera and we go away regretfully haunt by the voice of many wind blow bell. 
not ten minute from the pagoda we saw a real british bandstand a shanty label municipal office a collection of p. w. d. bungalow that in vain strive to blast the landscape and a madras band. i have never see madrassi troop before. they seem to dress just like tommies and have an air of much culture and refinement. it be say that they read english book and know all about their right and privilege. for further detail apply to the pegu club second table from the top on the right hand side a you enter. 
in an evil hour i attempt to revive the droop trade of moulmein and to this end bind a native of the place to come on board the steamer next morn with a collection of burmese silk. it be only a five minute pull and he could have sit in the stern all the while. morning come but not the man. not a boat of watermelon pink fleshy watermelon near the ship. we might have be in quarantine. a we slip down the river on our way to penang i saw the elephant play with the teak log a solemnly and a mysteriously a ever. they be the chief inhabitant and for aught i know the ruler of the place. their lethargy have corrupt the town and when the professor wish to photograph them i believe they go away in scorn. 
we be now run down to penang with the thermometer ¬∞ in the cabin and anything you please on deck. we have exhaust all our literature drink two hundred lemon squash. play forty different game of card. patience mostly. organise a lottery on the run. have it be a thousand rupee instead of ten i should not have win it. and sleep seventeen hour out of the twenty four. it be perfectly impossible to write but you may be morally the good for the story of the bad people of iquique which a you have not before hear i will now proceed to relate. it ha just be tell me by a german orchid hunter fresh from nearly lose his head in the lushai hill who ha be over most of the world. 
iquique be somewhere in south america at the back of or beyond brazil and once upon a time there come to it a tribe of aborigine from out of the wood so innocent that they wear nothing at all absolutely nothing at all. they have a grievance but no garment and the former they come to lay before his excellency the governor of iquique. but the news of their come and their exceed nakedness have go before them and good spanish lady of the town agree that the heathen should first of all be clothe. so they organise a sew bee and the result which be mainly apron be serve out to the bad people with hint a to it use. nothing could have be good. they appear in their apron before the governor and all the lady of iquique range on the step of the cathedral only to find that the governor could not grant their demand. and do you know what these child of nature do. in the twinkle of an eye they have off those apron sling them round their neck and be dance naked a the dawn before the scandalise lady of iquique who flee with their fan before their eye into the sanctuary of the cathedral. and when the step be desert the bad people withdraw shout and leap their apron still round their neck for good cloth be valuable property. they encamp near the town know their own power. twas impossible to send the military against them and equally impossible that donna and se√±oritas should be expose to the chance of be shock whenever they go abroad. no one know at what hour the bad people would sweep through the street. their demand be therefore grant and iquique have rest. nuda est veritas et prevalebit. 
but say i what be there so awful in a naked indian or two hundred naked indian for that matter. 
my friend say the german dey va indian of sout america. i dell you dey do not demselves shtrip vell. 
i put my hand on my mouth and go away. 
no. iv. 
show how i come to palmiste island and the place of paul and virginia and fell asleep in a garden. a disquisition on the folly of sight see. 
some for the glory of this world and some sigh for the prophet s paradise to come. ah take the cash and let the credit go nor heed the rumble of a distant drum. 
there be something very wrong in the anglo saxon character. hardly have the africa drop anchor in penang strait when two of our fellow passenger be smite with madness because they hear that another steamer be even then start for singapur. if they go by it they would gain several day. heaven know why time should have be so precious to them. the news send them fly into their cabin and pack their trunk a though their salvation depend upon it. then they tumble over the side and be row away in a sampan hot but happy. they be on a pleasure trip and they have gain perhaps three day. that be their pleasure. 
do you recollect besant s description of palmiste island in my little girl and so they be marry. penang be palmiste island. i find this out from the ship look at the wooded hill that dominate the town and at the regiment of palm tree three mile away that mark the coast of wellesley province. the air be soft and heavy with laziness and at the ship s side be boat load of much jewel madrassis even those to whom besant ha allude. a squall sweep across the water and blot out the row of low red tile house that make up penang and the shadow of night follow the storm. 
i put my twelve inch rule in my pocket to measure all the world by and nearly weep with emotion when on land at the jetty i fell against a sikh a beautiful beard sikh with white legging and a rifle. a be cold water in a thirsty land so be a face from the old country. my friend have come from jandiala in the umritsar district. do i know jandiala. do i not. i begin to tell all the news i could recollect about crop and army and the movement of big men in the far far north while the sikh beam. he belong to the military police and it be a good service but of course it be far from the old country. there be no hard work and the chinaman give but little trouble. they have fight among themselves but they do not care to give u any impudence. and the big man swagger off with the long roll and swing of a whole pioneer regiment while i cheer myself with the think that india the india i pretend to hold in hatred be not so far off after all. 
you know our ineradicable tendency to damn everything in the mofussil. calcutta profess astonishment that allahabad ha a good dance floor. allahabad wonder if it be true that lahore really ha an ice factory. and lahore pretend to believe that everybody in peshawar sleep arm. very much in the same way i be amuse at see a steam tramway in rangoon and after we have quit moulmein fully expect to find the outskirt of civilisation. vanity and ignorance be severely shock when they confront a long street of business a street of two storied house full of ticca gharies_ shop sign and above all jinrickshaws. 
you in india have never see a proper rickshaw. there be about two thousand of them in penang and no two seem alike. they be lacquer with bold figure of dragon and horse and bird and butterfly. their shaft be of black wood bind with white metal and so strong that the coolie sit upon them when he wait for his fare. there be only one coolie but he be strong and he run just a well a six bell men. he tie up his pigtail be a cantonese and this be a disadvantage to sahib who cannot speak tamil malay or cantonese. otherwise he might be steer like a camel. 
the rickshaw men be patient and long suffer. the evil visaged person who drive my carriage lash at them when they come within whip range and do his best to drive over them a he head for the waterfall which be five mile away from penang town. i expect that the building should stop choke out among the dense growth of cocoanut. but they continue for many street very like park and middleton street in calcutta where shutter house which be half breed between an indian bungalow and a rangoon rabbit hutch fight with the greenery and croton a big a small tree. now and again there blaze the front of a chinese house all open work vermilion lamp black and gold with six foot chinese lantern over the doorway and glimpse of quaintly cut shrub in the well keep garden beyond. 
we strike into road fringe with native house on pile shadow by the everlasting cocoanut palm heavy with young nut. the heat be heavy with the smell of vegetation and it be not the smell of the earth after the rain. some bird thing call out from the deep of the foliage and there be a mutter of thunder in the hill which we be approach. but all the rest be very still and the sweat run down our face in drop. 
now you ve get to walk up that hill say the driver point to a small barrier outside a well keep botanical garden. all the carriage stop here. one s limb move a though leaden and the breath come heavily draw in each time the vapour of a turkish bath. the soil be alive with wet and warmth and the unknown tree i be too sleepy to read the label that some offensively energetic man ha write be wet and warm too. up on the hillside the voice of the water be say something but i be too sleepy to listen. and on the top of the hill lay a fat cloud just like an eider down quilt tuck everything in safely. 
and in the afternoon they come unto a land in which it seem always afternoon. 
i sit down where i be for i saw that the upward path be very steep and be cut into rude step and an exposition of sleep have come upon me. i be at the mouth of a tiny gorge exactly where the lotus eater have sit down when they begin their song for i recognise the waterfall and the air round my ear breathe a one that ha a weary dream. 
i look and behold that i could not give in word the genius of the place. i can t play the flute but i have a cousin who play the violin. i know a man who could. some people say he be not a nice man and i might run the risk of contaminate moral but nothing matter in such a climate. see now go to the very bad of zola s novel and read there his description of a conservatory. that be it. several month pass away but there be neither chill nor burn heat to mark the passage of time. only with a sense of acute pain i felt that i must do the waterfall and i climb up the step in the hillside though every boulder cry sit down until i find a small stream of water course down the face of a rock and a much big one down my own. 
then we go away to breakfast the stomach be always more worthy than any amount of sentiment. a turn in the road hide the garden and stop the noise of the water and that experience be over for all time. experience be very like cheroot. they generally begin badly taste perfect half way through and at the butt end be thing to be throw away and never pick up again. 
his name be john and he have a pigtail five foot long all real hair and no silk braid and he keep an hotel by the way and feed u with a chicken into whose innocent flesh onion and strange vegetable have be force. till then we have fear chinaman especially when they bring food but now we will eat anything at their hand. the conclusion of the meal be a half guinea pineapple and a siesta. this be a beautiful thing which we of india but i be of india no more do not understand. you lie down and wait for time to pas. you be not in the least weary and you would not go to sleep. you be fill with a divine drowsiness quite different from the heavy sodden slumber of a hot weather sunday or the businesslike repose of a europe morning. now i begin to despise novelist who write about siesta in cold climate. i know what the real thing mean. 
* * * * *. 
i have be try to buy a few thing a sarong_ which be a putso which be a dhoti. a pipe. and a damn malayan kris. the sarong come chiefly from germany the pipe from the pawn shop and there be no kris except little toothpick thing that could not penetrate the hide of a malay. in the native town i find a large army of chinese more than i imagine exist in china itself encamp in spacious street and house some of them send block tin to singapur some drive fine carriage others make shoe chair clothe and every other thing that a large town desire. they be the first army corp on the march of the mongol. the scout be at calcutta and a fly column at rangoon. here begin the main body some hundred thousand strong so they say. be it not de quincey that have a horror of the chinese of their inhumaneness and their inscrutability. certainly the people in penang be not nice. they be even terrible to behold. they work hard which in this climate be manifestly wicked and their eye be just like the eye of their own pet dragon. our hindu god be passable some of them even jolly witness our pot belly ganesh. but what can you do with a people who revel in d. t. monster and crown their roof ridge with flame of fire or the wave of the sea. they swarm everywhere and wherever three or four meet there they eat thing without name the inside of duck for choice. our deck passenger i know fare sumptuously on offal beg from the steward and flavour with insect powder to keep the ant off. this again be not natural for a man should eat like a man if he work like one. i could quite understand after a couple of hour. this ha the true globe trotter twang to it. spend in chinatown why the low caste anglo saxon hate the celestial. he frighten me and so i could take no pleasure in look at his house at his ware or at himself. 
the smell of printer s ink be marvellously penetrate. it draw me up two pair of stair into an office where the exchange lay about in delightful disorder and a little hand press be clack out proof just in the old sweet way. something like the gazette of india show that the strait settlement even they have a government of their own and i sigh for a dead past a my eye catch the beautiful official phraseology that never vary. how alike we english be. here be an extract from a report. and the chinese form of decoration which formerly cover the office ha be wisely obliterate with whitewash. 
that be just what i come to inquire about. what be they go to do with the chinese decoration all over penang. would they try to wisely obliterate that. 
the strait settlement council which life at singapur have just pass a bill. ordinance they call it. put down all chinese secret society in the colony which measure only await the imperial assent. a little business in singapur connect with some municipal measure for clear away overhang verandah create a storm and for three day those who be in the place say the town be entirely at the mercy of the chinese who rise all together and make life unpleasant for the authority. this incident force the government to take serious notice of the secret society who could so control the action of men and the result ha be a measure which it will not be easy to enforce. a chinaman must have a secret society of some kind. he ha be breed up in a country where they be necessary to his comfort his protection and the maintenance of his scale of wage from time immemorial and he will carry them with him a he will carry his opium and his coffin. 
do you expect then that the society will collapse by proclamation. i ask the editor. 
no. there will be a row. 
what row. what sort of a row. 
more troop perhaps and perhaps some gunboat. you see we shall have sir charles warren then a our commander in chief at singapur. up till the present our military administration ha be subordinate to that of hong kong. when that be do away with and we have sir charles warren thing will be different. but there will be a row. neither you nor i nor any one else will be able to put these thing down. every joss house will be the head of a secret society. what can one do. in the past the government make some use of them for the detection of crime. now they be too big and too important to be treat in that way. you will know before long whether we have be able to suppress them. there will be a row. 
certainly the great grievance of penang be the chinese question. she would not be human do she not revile her municipal commissioner and talk about the unsanitary condition of the island. if nose and eye and ear be any guide she be far clean even in her street than many an indian cantonment and her water supply seem perfection. but i sit in that little newspaper office and listen to story of municipal intrigue that might have suit serampore or calcutta only the name be a little different and in place of ghose and chuckerbutty one hear title such a yih tat lo eng and the like. the englishman s aggressive altruism always lead him to build town for others and incite alien to serve on municipal board. then he get tire of his weakness and start paper to condemn himself. they have a chinaman on the municipality last year. they have now get rid of him and the present body be constitute of two official and four non official. therefore they complain of the influence of officialdom. 
have thoroughly settle all the difference of penang to my own great satisfaction i remove myself to a chinese theatre set in the open road and make of stick and old gunny bag. the orchestra alone convince me that there be something radically wrong with the chinese mind. once long ago in jummu i hear the infernal clang of the horn use by the devil dancer who have come from far beyond ladakh to do honour to the prince that day set upon his throne. that be about three thousand mile to the north but the character of the music be unchanged. a thousand chinaman stand a close a possible to the horrid din and enjoy it. once more can anything be do to a people without nerve a without digestion and if report speak truly without moral. but it be not true that they be bear with full size pigtail. the thing grow and in it very early stage be the pretty head dress imaginable be soft brown very fluffy about three inch long and dress a to the end with red silk. an infant pigtail be just like the first tender sprout of a tulip bulb and would be lovable be not the chinese baby so very horrible of hue and shape. he isn t a pretty a the pig that alice nurse in wonderland and he lie quite still and never cry. this be because he be afraid of be boil and eat. i saw cold boil baby on a plate be carry through the heart of the town. they say it be only suck pig but i know good. dead suck pig don t grin with their eye open. 
about this time the face of the chinese frighten me more than ever so i run away to the outskirt of the town and saw a windowless house that carry the square and compass in gold and teakwood above the door. i take heart at meet these familiar thing again and know that where they be be good fellowship and much charity in spite of all the secret society in the world. penang be to be congratulate on one of the pretty little lodge in the east. 
no. v. 
of the threshold of the far east and the dweller thereon. a dissertation upon the use of the british lion. 
how the world be make for each of u how all we perceive and know in it tend to some moment s product thus when a soul declare itself to wit by it fruit the thing it doe. 
i assure you sir weather a hot a this ha not be felt in singapur for year and year. march be always reckon our hot month but this be quite abnormal. 
and i make answer to the strange wearily. 
yes of course. they always tell that lie in the other place. leave me alone and let me drip. 
this be the heat of an orchid house a cling remorseless steam sweat that know no variation between night and day. singapur be another calcutta but much more so. in the suburb they be build row of cheap house. in the city they run over you and jostle you into the kennel. these be unfailing sign of commercial prosperity. india end so long ago that i cannot even talk about the native of the place. they be all chinese except where they be french or dutch or german. england be by the uninformed suppose to own the island. the rest belong to china and the continent but chiefly china. i know i have touch the border of the celestial empire when i be thoroughly impregnate with the reek of chinese tobacco a fine cut greasy glossy weed to whose smoke the aroma of a huqa in the cookhouse be all rimmell s shop. 
providence conduct me along a beach in full view of five mile of ship five solid mile of mast and funnel to a place call raffle hotel where the food be a excellent a the room be bad. let the traveller take note. fee at raffle and sleep at the hotel de l europe. i would have do this but for the apparition of two large lady tastefully attire in bedgowns who sit with their foot prop on a chair. this joseph run. but it turn out that they be dutch lady from batavia and that that be their national costume till dinner time. 
if a you say they have on stocking and dress gown you have nothing to complain of. they generally wear nothing but a night gown till five o clock quoth a man verse in the habit of the land. 
i do not know whether he speak the truth. i be incline to think that he do. but now i know what batavian grace really mean i don t approve of it. a lady in a dress gown disturb the mind and prevent careful consideration of the political outlook in singapur which be now supply with a set of very complete fort and be hopefully await some nine inch breach loader that be to adorn them. there be something very pathetic in the trustful cling attitude of the colony who ought to have be sour and mistrustful long ago. we hope the home government may do this. it be possible that the home government may do that be the burden of the song and in every place where the englishman cannot breed successfully must continue to be. imagine an india fit for permanent habitation by our kin and consider what a place it would be this day with the painter cut fifty year ago fifty thousand mile of railway lay down and ten thousand under survey and possibly an annual surplus. be this sedition. forgive me but i be look at the ship outside the verandah at the chinaman in the street and at the lazy languid englishman in banian and white jacket stretch on the cane chair and these thing be not nice. the men be not really lazy a i will try to show late on but they lounge and loaf and seem to go to office at eleven which must be bad for work. and they all talk about go home at indecently short interval a though that be their right. once more if we could only rear child that do not run to leg and nose in the second generation in this part of the world and one or two others what an amaze disruption of the empire there would be before half of a parnell commission sit be accomplish. and then late when the free state have plunge into hot water fight their fight overborrowed overspeculated and otherwise conduct themselves like young son what a come together and revision of tariff end in one great iron band girdle the earth. within that limit free trade. without rancorous protection. it would be too vast a hornet s nest for any combination of power to disturb. the dream will not come about for a long time but we shall accomplish something like it one of these day. the bird of passage from canada from borneo borneo that will have to go through a general rough and tumble before she grip her possibility from australia from a hundred scatter island be say the same thing. we be not strong enough yet but some day we shall be. 
oh. dear people stew in india and swear at all the government it be a glorious thing to be an englishman. our lot ha fall unto u in a fair grind. yea we have a goodly heritage. take a map and look at the long stretch of the malay peninsula a thousand mile southerly it run doe it not. whereon penang malacca and singapur be so modestly underline in red ink. see now. we have our resident at every one of the malay native state of any importance and right up the line to kedah and siam our influence regulate and control all. into this land god put first gold and tin and after these the englishman who float company obtain concession and go forward. just at present one company alone hold a concession of two thousand square mile in the interior. that mean mine right. and that mean a few thousand cooly and a settle administration such a obtain in the big indian colliery where the head of the mine be responsible king. 
with the company will come the railroad. so far the strait paper spend their space in talk about them for at present there be only twenty three or twenty four mile of narrow gauge railway open near a civilise place call pirate creek in the peninsula. the sultan of johore be or ha be waver over a concession for a railway through his country which will ultimately connect with this pirate creek line. singapur be resolve ere long to bridge over the mile or mile and a half strait between herself and the state of johore. in this manner a begin will be make of the southerly extension of colquhoun s great line run let u say from singapur through the small state and siam without a break into the great indian railway system so that a man will be able to book from here to calcutta direct. anything like a business summary of the railway scheme that come up for discussion from time to time would fill a couple of these letter and would be uncommonly dry read. you know the sort of shop talk that rage among engineer when a new line be be run in india through perfectly know grind whose traffic potentiality may be calculate to the last pie. it be very much the same here with the difference that no one know for a certainty what the country ahead of the survey be like or where the development be likely to stop. this give breeziness to the conversation. the audacity of the speaker be amaze to one who ha be accustom to see thing through indian eye. they hint at run up the peninsula establish communication here consolidate influence there and providence only know what else. but never a word do they breathe about the necessity for increase troop to stand by and back these little operation. perhaps they assume that the home government will provide but it doe seem strange to hear them cold bloodedly discuss notion that will inevitably demand double garrison to keep the venture out of alien hand. however the merchant men will do their work and i suppose we shall borrow three file and a sergeant from somewhere or other when the time come and people begin to realise what sort of a gift our strait settlement be. it be so cheap to prophesy. they will in the near future grow into. 
the professor look over my shoulder at this point. bosh. say he. they will become just a supplementary china another field for chinese cheap labour. when the dutch settlement be return in all these island hereabouts you know we should have hand over these place a well. look. he point at the swarm chinaman below. 
let me dream my dream fessor. i ll take my hat in a minute and settle the question of chinese immigration in five minute. but i confess it be mournful to look into the street which ought to have be full of beharis madrassis and men from the konkan from our india. 
then up and spake a sunburn man who have interest in north borneo he own cave in the mountain some of them nine hundred foot high so please you and fill with the guano of age and have be tell me leech story till my flesh crawl. north borneo say he calmly want a million of labourer to do her any good. one million cooly. men be want everywhere in the peninsula in sumatra for the tobacco plant in java everywhere. but borneo the company s province that be to say need a million cooly. it be pleasant to oblige a strange and i felt that i speak with india at my back. we could oblige you with two million or twenty for the matter of that say i generously. 
your men be no good say the north borneo man. if one man go away he must have a whole village to look after his want. india a a labour field be no good to u and the sumatra men say that your cooly either can t or win t tend tobacco properly. we must have china cooly a the land develop. 
oh india oh my country. this it be to have inherit a highly organise civilisation and an ancient precedence code. that your child shall be scoff at by the alien a useless outside their own pot bind province. here be a labour outlet a door to full dinner through which men yellow men with pigtail be pour by the ten thousand while in bengal the culture native editor be shriek over atrocity commit in move a few hundred soul a few hundred mile into assam. 
no. vi. 
of the well dress islander of singapur and their diversion. prove that all station be exactly alike. show how one chicago jew and an american child can poison the pure mind. 
we be not divide all one body we one in hope and doctrine one in charity. 
when one come to a new station the first thing to do be to call on the inhabitant. this duty i have neglect prefer to consort with chinese till the sabbath when i learn that singapur go to the botanical garden and listen to secular music. 
all the englishman in the island congregate there. the botanical garden would have be lovely at kew but here where one know that they be the only place of recreation open to the inhabitant they be not pleasant. all the plant of all the tropic grow there together and the orchid house be roof with thin batten of wood just enough to keep off the direct ray of the sun. it hold waxy white splendour from manila the philippine and tropical africa plant that be half slug draw nourishment apparently from their own wooden label. but there be no difference between the temperature of the orchid house and the open air. both be heavy dank and steam. i would have give a month s pay but i have no month s pay for a clear breath of stifle hot wind from the sand of sirsa for the darkness of a punjab dust storm in exchange for the perspire plant and the tree fern that sweat audibly. 
just when i be most impress with my measureless distance from india my carriage advance to the sound of slow music and i find myself in the middle of an indian station not quite a big a allahabad and infinitely pretty than lucknow. it overlook the garden that slop in ridge and hollow below. and the barrack be set in much greenery and there be a mess house that suggest long and cool drink and there walk round about a british band. it be just we our noble self. in the centre be the pretty memsahib with light hair and fascinate manner and the plump little memsahib that talk to everybody and be in everybody s confidence and the spinster fresh from home and the bean feed well groom subaltern with the light coat and fox terrier. on the bench sit the fat colonel and the large judge and the engineer s wife and the merchant man and his family after their kind male and female meet i them and but for the little fact that they be entire stranger to me i would have salute them all a old friend. i know what they be talk about could see them take stock of one another s dress out of the corner of their eye could see the young men back and fill across the grind in order to walk with the young maiden and could hear the do you think so s and not really s of our polite conversation. it be an awful thing to sit in a hire carriage and watch one s own people and know that though you know their life you have neither part nor lot in it. 
i be a shadow now. ala. ala. upon the skirt of human nature dwell. 
i say mournfully to the professor. he be look at mr. or some one so like her that it come to the same thing. be i travel round the world to discover these people. say he. i ve see em all before. there s captain such an one and colonel such another and miss what s it name a large a life and twice a pale. 
the professor have hit it. that be the difference. people in singapur be dead white a white a naaman and the vein on the back of their hand be paint in indigo. 
it be a though the rain be just over and none of the womenfolk have be allow to go to the hill. yet no one talk about the unhealthiness of singapur. a man life well and happily until he begin to feel unwell. then he feel bad because the climate allow him no chance of pull himself together and then he dy. typhoid fever appear to be one gate of death a it be in india. also liver. the nice thing in the civil station which lie of course far from the native town and boast pretty little bungalow be thomas dear white rob swagger smoke swear thomas atkins the unchangeable who listen to the band and wander down the bazaar and sling the unmentionable adjective about the palm tree exactly a though he be in mian mir. the th. northamptonshire. live in these part. so singapur be quite safe you see. 
nobody would speak to me in the garden though i felt that they ought to have invite me to drink and i creep back to my hotel to eat six different fresh chutnies with one curry. 
* * * * *. 
i want to go home. i want to go back to india. i be miserable. the steamship nawab at this time of the year ought to have be empty instead of which we have one hundred first class passenger and sixty six second. all the pretty girl be in the latter class. something must have happen at colombo two steamer must have clash. we have the result of the collision and we be a menagerie. the captain say that there ought to have be only ten or twelve passenger by right and have the rush be anticipate a large steamer would have be provide. personally i consider that half our shipmate ought to be throw overboard. they be only travel round the world for pleasure and that sort of dissipation lead to the form of hasty and intemperate opinion. anyhow give me freedom and the cockroach of the british india where we din on deck alter the hour of the meal by plebiscite and be lord of all we saw. you know the chain gang regulation of the p. and o. how you must approach the captain stand on your head with your foot wave reverently. how you must crawl into the presence of the chief steward on your belly and call him thrice puissant bottle washer. how you must not smoke abaft the sheep pen. must not stand in the companion. must put on a clean coat when the ship s library be open. and crown injustice must order your drink for tiffin and dinner one meal in advance. how can a man full of pilsener beer reach that keen set state of quiescence needful for order his dinner liquor. this show ignorance of human nature. the p. and o. want healthy competition. they call their captain commander and act a though twere a favour to allow you to embark. again freedom and the british india for ever and down with the comfort of a coolie ship and the price of a palace. 
there be about thirty woman on board and i have be watch with a certain amount of indignation their concert attempt at kill the stewardess a delicate and sweet mannered lady. i think they will accomplish their end. the saloon be ninety foot long and the stewardess run up and down it for nine hour a day. in her interval of relaxation she carry cup of beef tea to the frail sylph who cannot exist without food between a. m. and p. m. this morning she advance to me and say a though it be the most natural thing in the world. shall i take away your tea cup sir. she be a real white woman and the saloon be full of hulk half breed portuguese. one young englishman let her take his cup and actually do not turn round when he hand it. this be awful and teach me a nothing else ha do how far i be from the bless east. she. the stewardess. talk stand up to men who sit down. 
we in india be currently suppose to be unkind to our servant. i should very much like to see a sweeper do one half of the work these strap white matron and maid exact from their sister. they make her carry thing about and don t even say thank you. she ha no name and if you bawl stewardess she be bind to come. isn t it degrade. 
but the real reason of my wish to return be because i have meet a lump of chicago jew and be afraid that i shall meet many more. the ship be full of american but the american german jew boy be the most awful of all. one of them ha money and wander from bow to stern ask stranger to drink boss lottery on the run and commit other atrocity. it be currently report that he be die. unfortunately he doe not die quickly enough. 
but the real monstrosity of the ship be an american who be not quite grow up. i cannot call it a boy though officially it be only eight wear a strip jacket and eat with the child. it ha the weary appearance of an infant monkey there be line round it mouth and under it eyebrow. when it ha nothing else to do it will answer to the name of albert. it ha be two year on the continuous travel. ha spend a month in india. ha see constantinople tripoli spain. ha live in tent and on horseback for thirty day and thirty night a it be careful to inform me. and ha exhaust the round of this world s delight. there be no flesh on it bone and it life in the smoke room finance the arrangement of the daily lottery. i be afraid of it but it follow me and in a level expressionless voice begin to tell me how lottery be construct. when i protest that i know it continue without regard the interruption and finally a a reward for my patience volunteer to give me the name and idiosyncracies of all on board. then it vanish through the smoke room window because the door be only eight foot high and therefore too narrow for that bulk of abnormal experience. on certain subject it be partly good inform than i. on others it display the infinite credulity of a two year old. but the weary eye be ever the same. they will be the same when it be fifty. i be more sorry for it than i could say. all it reminiscence have get jumble and incident of spain be bale into turkey and india. some day a schoolmaster will get hold of it and try to educate it and i should dearly like to see at which end he will begin. the head be too full already and the the other part doe not exist. albert be i presume but an ordinary american child. he be to me a revelation. now i want to see a little american girl but not now not just now. my nerve be shatter by the jew and albert. and unless they recover their tone i shall turn back at yokohama. 
no. vii. 
show how i arrive in china and saw entirely through the great wall and out upon the other side. 
where naked ignorance deliver brawl judgment all day long on all thing unashamed. 
the past few day on the nawab have be spend amid a new people and a very strange one. there be speculator from south africa. financier from home. these never talk in anything under hundred of thousand of pound and i fear bluff awfully. there be consul of far off china port and partner of china ship house talk a talk and think thought a different from ours a be our slang from the slang of london. but it would not interest you to learn the story of our shipload to hear about the hard head scotch merchant with a taste for spiritualism who beg me to tell him whether there be really anything in theosophy and whether tibet be full of levitate chelas_ a he believe. or of the little london curate out for a holiday who have see india and have faith in the progress of missionary work there who believe that the c. m. s. be shake the thought and conviction of the mass and that the word of the lord would ere long prevail above all other council. he in the night watch tackle and dispose of the great mystery of life and death and be look forward to a lifetime of toil amid a parish without a single rich man in it. 
when you be in the china sea be careful to keep all your flannel wear to hand. in an hour the steamer swing from tropical heat. include prickly. to a cold raw fog a wet a a scotch mist. morning give u a new world somewhere between heaven and earth. the sea be smoke glass. reddish grey island lay upon it under fog bank that hover fifty foot above our head. the squat sail of junk dance for an instant like autumn leaf in the breeze and disappear and there be no solidity in the island against which the glassy level splinter in snow. the steamer groan and grunt and howl because she be so damp and miserable and i groan also because the guide book say that hong kong have the fine harbour in the world and i could not see two hundred yard in any direction. yet this ghost like in glide through the belt fog be livelily mysterious and become more so when the movement of the air vouchsafe u a glimpse of a warehouse and a derrick both apparently close aboard and behind them the shoulder of a mountain. we make our way into a sea of flat nose boat all man by most muscular human and the professor say that the time to study the chinese question be now. we however be carry a new general to these part and nice new well fit uniform come off to make him welcome. and in the contemplation of thing too long withhold from me i forget about the pigtail. gentleman of the mess room who would wear linen coat on parade if you could wait till you have be a month without see a patrol jacket or hear a spur go ling a ling_ and you will know why civilian want you always to wear uniform. the general by the way be a nice general. he do not know much about the indian army or the way of a gentleman call robert if i recollect aright. but he say that lord wolseley be go to be commander in chief one of these day on account of the press need of our army. he be a revelation because he talk about nothing but english military matter which be very very different from indian one and be mix up with politics. 
all hong kong be build on the sea face. the rest be fog. one muddy road run for ever in front of a line of house which be partly chowringhee and partly rotherhithe. you live in the house and when weary of this walk across the road and drop into the sea if you can find a square foot of unencumbered water. so vast be the accumulation of country ship and such be it dirtiness a it rub against the bund that the superior inhabitant be compel to hang their boat from davit above the common craft who be greatly disturb by a multitude of steam launch. these ply for amusement and the pleasure of whistle and be hold in such small esteem that every hotel own one and the others be masterless. beyond the launch lie more steamer than the eye can count and four out of five of these belong to u. i be proud when i saw the ship at singapur but i swell with patriotism a i watch the fleet of hong kong from the balcony of the victoria hotel. i can almost spit into the water. but many mariner stand below and they be a strong breed. 
how recklessly selfish doe a traveller become. we have drop for more than ten day all the world outside our trunk and almost the first word in the hotel be. john bright be dead and there ha be an awful hurricane at samoa. 
ah. indeed that s very sad. but look here where do you say my room be. at home the news would have give talk for half a day. it be dismiss in half the length of a hotel corridor. one cannot sit down to think with a new world hum outside the window with all china to enter upon and posse. 
a rattle of trunk in the hall a click of heel and the apparition of an enormous gaunt woman wrestle with a small madrassi servant. yes i haf travel everywhere and i shall travel everywhere else. i go now to shanghai and pekin. i have be in moldavia russia beyrout all persia colombo delhi dacca benares allahabad peshawar the ali musjid in that pas malabar singapur penang here in this place and canton. i be austrian croat and i shall see the state of america and perhaps ireland. i travel for ever. i be how you call. veuve widow. my husband he be dead. and so i be sad i be always sad und so i trafel. i be alife of course but i do not live. you onderstandt. always sad. vill you tell them the name of the ship to which they shall warf my trunk now. you trafel for pleasure. so. i trafel because i be alone und sad always sad. 
the trunk disappear the door shut the heel click down the passage and i be leave scratch my head in wonder. how do that conversation begin why do it end and what be the use of meet eccentricity who never explain themselves. i shall never get an answer but that conversation be true every word of it. i see now where the fragmentary school of novelist get their material from. 
when i go into the street of hong kong i step into thick slushy london mud of the kind that strike chilly through the boot and the rattle of innumerable wheel be a the rattle of hansom. a soak rain fell and all the sahib hail rickshaw they call them rick here and the wind be chilly than the rain. it be the first touch of honest weather since calcutta. no wonder with such a climate that hong kong be ten time lively than singapur that there be sign of build everywhere and gas jet in all the house that colonnade and dome be scatter broadcast and the englishman walk a englishman should hurriedly and look forward. all the length of the main street be verandahed and the europe shop squander plate glass by the square yard. nota bene. a in simla so elsewhere. mistrust the plate glass shop. you pay for their fitting in each purchase. 
the same providence that run big river so near to large city put main thoroughfare close to big hotel. i go down queen street which be not very hilly. all the other street that i look up be build in step after the fashion of clovelly and under blue sky would have give the professor score of good photograph. the rain and the fog blot the view. each upward climb street run out in white mist that cover the side of a hill and the downward slop one be lose in the steam from the water of the harbour and both be very strange to see. hi yi yow say my rickshaw coolie and balance me on one wheel. i get out and meet first a german with a beard then three jolly sailor boy from a man of war then a sergeant of sapper then a parsee then two arab then an american then a jew then a few thousand chinese all carry something and then the professor. 
they make plate instantaneous plate in tokio i m tell. what d you think of that. he say. why in india the survey department be the only people who make their own plate. instantaneous plate in tokio. think of it. 
i have owe the professor one for a long time. after all i reply it strike me that we have make the mistake of think too much of india. we think we be civilise for instance. let u take a low place. this beat calcutta into a hamlet. 
and in good truth it do because it be clean beyond the ordinary because the house be uniform three storied and verandahed and the pavement be of stone. i meet one horse very ashamed of himself who be look after a cart on the sea road but upstairs there be no vehicle save rickshaw. hong kong ha kill the romance of the rickshaw in my mind. they ought to be sacred to pretty lady instead of which men go to office in them officer in full canonicals use them. tar try to squeeze in two abreast and from what i have hear down at the barrack they do occasionally bring to the guard room the drunken defaulter. he fall asleep inside of it sir and save trouble. the chinese naturally have the town for their own and profit by all our build improvement and regulation. their golden and red sign flame down the queen s road but they be careful to supplement their own tongue by well execute europe letter. i find only one exception thus. 
fuss garpenter and gabinet naktr ha good gabi net tor sale. 
the shop be make to catch the sailor and the curio hunter and they succeed admirably. when you come to these part put all your money in a bank and tell the manager man not to give it you however much you ask. so shall you be save from bankruptcy. 
the professor and i make a pilgrimage from kee sing even unto yi king who sell the decompose fowl and each shop be good. though it sell shoe or suck pig there be some delicacy of carve or gild tracery in front to hold the eye and each thing be quaint and strike of it kind. a fragment of twist root help by a few stroke into the liken of huddle devil a run knop and flower cornice a dull red and gold half door a split bamboo screen they be all good and their joining and splicing and mortise be accurate. the basket of the cooly be good in shape and the rattan fastening that clench them to the polish bamboo yoke be whip down so that there be no loose end. you could slide in and out the drawer in the sling chest of the man who sell dinner to the rickshaw cooly. and the piston of the little wooden hand pump in the shop work accurately in their socket. 
i be study these thing while the professor be roam through carve ivory broider silk panel of inlay tortoise shell filigree jade tip pipe and the god of art only know what else. 
i don t think even a much of him. mean our indian craftsman. a i use to do say the professor take up a tiny ivory grotesque of a small baby try to pull a water buffalo out of it wallow the whole story of beast and baby write in the hard ivory. the same think be in both our mind. we have go near the subject once or twice before. 
they be a hundred time his superior in mere idea let alone execution say the professor his hand on a sketch in wood and gem of a woman catch in a gale of wind protect her baby from it violence. 
yes. and don t you see that they only introduce aniline dye into thing intend for u. whereas he wear them on his body whenever he can. what make this yellow image of a shopman here take delight in a dwarf orange tree in a turquoise blue pot. i continue sort a bundle of cheap china spoon all good in form colour and use. the big belly chinese lantern above u sway in the wind with a soft chafe of oil paper but they make no sign and the shopkeeper in blue be equally useless. 
you wanchee buy. heap plitty thing here say he. and he fill a tobacco pipe from a dull green leather pouch hold at the mouth with a little bracelet of plasma or it might have be the very jade. he be play with a brown wood abacus and by his side be his day book bind in oil paper and the tray of indian ink with the brush and the porcelain support for the brush. he make an entry in his book and daintily paint in his late transaction. the chinese of course have be do this for a few thousand year but life and it experience be a new to me a it be to adam and i marvel. 
wanchee buy. reiterate the shopman after he have make his last flourish. 
you say i in the new tongue which i be acquire wanchee know one piecee information b long my pidgin. savvy these thing. have get soul you. 
have get how. 
have get one piecee soul allee same spilit. no savvy. this way then your people lookee allee same devil. but makee culio allee same pocket joss and not give any explanation. why for be you such a horrible contradiction. 
no savvy. two dollar an half he say balance a cabinet in his hand. the professor have not hear. his mind be oppress with the fate of the hindu. 
there be three race who can work say the professor look down the seethe street where the rickshaw tear up the slush and the babel of cantonese and pidgin go up to the yellow fog in a jumble snarl. 
but there be only one that can swarm i answer. the hindu cut his own throat and dy and there be too few of the sahib log to last for ever. these people work and spread. they must have soul or they couldn t understand pretty thing. 
i can t make it out say the professor. they be good artist than the hindu that carve you be look at be japanese by the way good artist and strong workman man for man. they pack close and eat everything and they can live on nothing. 
and i ve be praise the beauty of indian art all my day. it be a little disappoint when you come to think of it but i try to console myself by the think that the two lay so far apart there be no comparison possible. and yet accuracy be surely the touchstone of all art. 
they will overwhelm the world say the professor calmly and he go out to buy tea. 
neither at penang singapur nor this place have i see a single chinaman asleep while daylight last. nor have i see twenty men who be obviously loaf. all be go to some definite end if it be only like the coolie on the wharf to steal wood from the scaffold of a half build house. in his own land i believe the chinaman be treat with a certain amount of carelessness not to say ferocity. where he hide his love of art the heaven that make him out of the yellow earth that hold so much iron only know. his love be for little thing or else why should he get quaint pendant for his pipe and at the backmost back of his shop build up for himself a bowerbird s collection of odds and end every one of which ha beauty if you hold it sufficiently close to the eye. it grief me that i cannot account for the idea of a few hundred million men in a few hour. this much however seem certain. if we have control over a many chinaman a we have native of india and have give them one tithe of the cossetting the painful push forward and studious even nervous regard of their interest and aspiration that we have give to india we should long ago have be expel from or have reap the reward of the rich land on the face of the earth. a pair of my shoe have be oddly enough wrap in a newspaper which carry for it motto the word there be no indian nation though there exist the germ of an indian nationality or something very like that. this thing ha be move me to unholy laughter. the great big lazy land that we nurse and wrap in cotton wool and ask every morning whether it be strong enough to get out of bed seem like a heavy soft cloud on the far away horizon. and the babble that we be wont to raise about it precious future and it possibility no more than the talk of child in the street who have make a horse out of a pea pod and match stick and wonder if it will ever walk. i be sadly out of conceit of mine own other not mother country now that i have have my boot black at once every time i happen to take them off. the black do not do it for the sake of a gratuity but because it be his work. like the beaver of old he have to climb that tree. the dog be after him. there be competition. 
* * * * *. 
be there really such a place a hong kong. people say so but i have not yet see it. once indeed the cloud lift and i saw a granite house perch like a cherub on nothing a thousand foot above the town. it look a if it might be the begin of a civil station but a man come up the street and say see this fog it will be like this till september. you d good go away. i shall not go. i shall encamp in front of the place until the fog lift and the rain cease. at present and it be the third day of april i be sit in front of a large coal fire and think of the frosty caucasus you poor creature in torment afar. and you think a you go to office and orderly room that you be help forward england s mission in the east. ti a pretty delusion and i be sorry to destroy it but you have conquer the wrong country. 
let u annex china. 
no. viii. 
of jenny and her friend. show how a man may go to see life and meet death there. of the felicity of life and the happiness of corinthian kate. the woman and the cholera. 
love and let love and so will i but sweet for me no more with you not while i live not though i die. good night good by. 
i be entirely the man about town and sickness be no word for my sentiment. it begin with an idle word in a bar room. it end goodness know where. that the world should hold french german and italian lady of the ancient profession be no great marvel. but it be to one who ha live in india something shock to meet again englishwoman in the same sisterhood. when an opulent papa send his son and heir round the world to enlarge his mind doe he reflect i wonder on the place into which the innocent stroll under the guidance of equally inexperienced friend. i be dispose to think that he doe not. in the interest of the opulent papa and from a genuine desire to see what they call life with a capital hell i go through hong kong for the space of a night. i be glad that i be not a happy father with a stray son who think that he know all the rope. vice must be pretty much the same all the round world over but if a man wish to get out of pleasure with it let him go to hong kong. 
of course thing be out and away good at frisco say my guide but we consider this very fair for the island. it be not till a fat person in a black dress gown begin to squeal demand for horrible stuff call a bottle of wine that i begin to understand the glory of the situation. i be see life. life be a great thing. it consist in swig sweet champagne that be steal from a steward of the p. and o. and exchange bad word with pale face baggage who laugh demnibly without effort and without emotion. the argot of the real chippy. this mean man of the world anglice_ a half drink youth with his hat on the back of his head. be not easy to come at. it require an apprenticeship in america. i stand appal at the depth and richness of the american language of which i be privilege to hear a special dialect. there be girl who have be to leadville and denver and the wild of the wild west who have act in minor company and who have generally misconduct themselves in a hundred weary way. they chatter like daw and shovel down the sickly liquor that make the room reek. a long a they talk sensibly thing be amuse but a sufficiency of liquor make the mask drop and verily they swear by all their god chief of whom be obidicut. very many men have hear a white woman swear but some few and among these i have be be deny the experience. it be quite a revelation. and if nobody tilt you backwards out of your chair you can reflect on heap of thing connect with it. so they curse and they drink and they tell tale sit in a circle till i felt that this be really life and a thing to be quit if i wish to like it. the young man who know a thing or two and give the girl leave to sell him if they could be there of course and the hussy sell him a he stand for all he consider himself worth. and i saw the by play. surely the safe way to be fool be to know everything. then there be an interlude and some more shriek and howl which the generous public take a indicate immense mirth and enjoyment of life. and i come to yet another establishment where the landlady lack the half of her leave lung a a cough betray but be none the le amuse in a dreary way until she also drop the mask and the playful jest begin. all the joke i have hear before at the other place. it be a poor sort of life that cannot spring one new jest a day. more than ever do the youth cock his hat and explain that he be a real chippy and that there be no fly on him. any one without a cast iron head would be real chippy next morning after one glass of that sirupy champagne. i understand now why men feel insult when sweet fizz be offer to them. the second interview close a the landlady gracefully cough u into the passage and so into the healthy silent street. she be very ill indeed and announce that she have but four month more to live. 
be we go to hold these dismal levee all through the night. i demand at the fourth house where i dread the repetition of the thrice tell tale. 
it s good in frisco. must amuse the girl a little bite y know. walk round and wake em up. that s life. you never saw it in india. be the reply. 
no thank god i didn t. a week of this would make me hang myself i return lean wearily against a door post. there be very loud sound of revelry by night here and the inmate need no wake up. one of them be recover from a debauch of three day and the other be just enter upon the same course. providence protect me all through. a certain austere beauty of countenance have make every one take me for a doctor or a parson a qualify parson i think. and so i be spar many of the more pronounce joke and could sit and contemplate the life that be so sweet. i think of the oxonian in tom and jerry play jig at the spinet you see the old fashion plate while corinthian tom and corinthian kate dance a stately saraband in a little carpet room. the bad of it be the woman be real woman and pretty and like some people i know and when they stop the insensate racket for a while they be well behave. 
pas for real lady anywhere say my friend. aren t these thing well manage. 
then corinthian kate begin to bellow for more drink it be three in the morning and the current of hideous talk recommence. 
they speak about themselves a gay. this doe not look much on paper. to appreciate the full grimness of the sarcasm hear it from their lip amid their own surround. i wink with vigour to show that i appreciate life and be a real chippy and that upon me too there be no fly. there be an intoxication in company that carry a man to excess of mirth. but when a party of four deliberately sit down to drink and swear the bottom tumble out of the amusement somehow and loathe and boredom follow. a night s reflection ha convince me that there be no hell for these woman in another world. they have their own in this life and i have be through it a little way. still carry the brevet rank of doctor it be my duty to watch through the night to the dawn a patient gay toujours gay remember quiver on the verge of a complaint call the jump. corinthian kate will get hers late on. her companion emerge from a heavy drink be more than enough for me. she be an unmitigated horror until i lose detestation in genuine pity. the fear of death be upon her for a reason that you shall hear. 
i say you say you come from india. do you know anything about cholera. 
a little i answer. the voice of the questioner be crack and quaver. a long pause. 
i say doctor what be the symptom of cholera. a woman die just over the street there last week. 
this be pleasant i think. but i must remember that it be life. 
she die last week cholera. my god i tell you she be dead in six hour. i guess i ll get cholera too. i can t though. can i. i think i have it two day ago. it hurt me terribly. i can t get it can i. it never attack people twice doe it. oh say it doesn t and be damn to you. doctor what be the symptom of cholera. 
i wait till she have detail her own attack assure her that these and no others be the symptom and may this be set to my credit that cholera never attack twice. this soothe her for ten minute. then she spring up with an oath and shriek. 
i win t be bury in hong kong. that frighten me. when i die of cholera take me to frisco and bury me there. in frisco lone mountain frisco you hear doctor. 
i hear and promise. outside the bird be begin to twitter and the dawn be pencil the shutter. 
i say doctor do you ever know cora pearl. 
know of her. i wonder whether she be go to walk round the room to all eternity with her eye glare at the ceiling and her hand twist and untwist one within the other. 
well she begin in an impressive whisper it be young duval shoot himself on her mat and make a bloody mess there. i mean real bloody. you don t carry a pistol doctor. savile do. you didn t know savile. he be my husband in the state. but i m english pure english. that s what i be. let s have a bottle of wine i m so nervous. not good for me. what the no you re a doctor. you know what s good against cholera. tell me. tell me. 
she cross to the shutter and star out her hand upon the bolt and the bolt clack against the wood because of the tremulous hand. 
i tell you corinthian kate s drink full a she can hold. she s always drink. do you ever see my shoulder these two mark on it. they be give me by a man a gentleman the night before last. i didn t fall against any furniture. he strike me with his cane twice the beast the beast the beast. if i have be full i d have knock the dust out of him. the beast. but i only go into the verandah and cry fit to break my heart. oh the beast. 
she pace the room chafe her shoulder and croon over it a though it be an animal. then she swear at the man. then she fell into a sort of stupor but moan and swear at the man in her sleep and wail for her amah to come and dress her shoulder. 
asleep she be not unlovely but the mouth twitch and the body be shake with shivering and there be no peace in her at all. daylight show her purple eye slack cheek and star rack with a headache and the nervous twitch. indeed i be see life. but it do not amuse me for i felt that i though i only make capital of her extreme woe be guilty equally with the rest of my kind that have bring her here. 
then she tell lie. at least i be inform that they be lie late on by the real man of the world. they relate to herself and her people and if untrue must have be motiveless for all be sordid and sorrowful though she try to gild the page with a book of photo which link her to her past. not be a man of the world i prefer to believe that the tale be true and thank her for the honour she do me in the tell. 
i have fancy that the house have nothing sad to show me than her face. here be i wrong. corinthian kate have really be drink and rise up reel drink which be an awful thing to witness and make one s head ache sympathetically. something have go wrong in the slatternly menage where the plat tea service be mix with cheap china. and the household be be call to account. i watch her clutch the mosquito net for support a horror and an offence in the eye of the guiltless day. i hear her swear in a thick sodden voice a i have never yet hear a man swear and i marvel that the house do not thunder in on our head. her companion interpose but be bear down by a torrent of blasphemy and the half a dozen little dog that infest the room remove themselves beyond reach of corinthian kate s hand or foot. that she be a handsome woman only make the matter bad. the companion collapse shiver on one of the couch and kate sway to and fro and curse god and man and earth and heaven with puff lip. if alma tadema could have paint her an arrangement in white black hair flash eye and bare foot we should have see the true liken of the eternal priestess of humanity. or she would have be good draw when the passion be over totter across the room a champagne glass hold high above her head shout at ten o clock in the morning for some more of the infamous brewage that be even then poison the air of the whole house. she get her liquor and the two woman sit down to share it together. that be their breakfast. 
i go away very sick and miserable and a the door close i saw the two drink. 
out and away good in frisco say the real chippy one. but you see they be awfully nice could pas for lady any time they like. i tell you a man ha to go round and keep his eye open among them when he s see a little sport life. 
i have see all that i wish to see and henceforward i will pas. there may be good champagne and good drinker in frisco and elsewhere but the talk will be the same and the mouldiness and staleness of it all will be the same till the end of time. if this be life give me a little honest death without drink and without foul jest. anyway you look at it ti a poor performance badly play and too near to a tragedy to be pleasant. but it seem to amuse the young man wander about the world and i cannot believe that it be altogether good for him unless indeed it make him fond of his home. 
and mine be the great sin. i be drive by no gust of passion but go in cold blood to make my account of this inferno and to measure the measureless misery of life. for the wholly insignificant sum of thirty dollar i have purchase information and disgust more than i require and the right to look after a woman half craze with drink and fear the third part of a terrible night. mine be the great sin. 
when we step back into the world i be glad that the fog stand between myself and the heaven above. 
no. ix. 
some talk with a taipan and a general. prof in what manner a sea picnic may be a success. 
i should like to rise and go where the golden apple grow where beneath another sky parrot island anchor lie. 
r. l. stevenson. 
hong kong be so much alive so build so light and so bloatedly rich to all outward appearance that i want to know how these thing come about. you can t lavish granite by the cubic ton for nothing or rivet your cliff with portland cement or build a five mile bund or establish a club like a small palace. i seek a taipan_ which mean the head of an english trade firm. he be the big taipan on the island and quite the nice. he own ship and wharf and house and mine and a hundred other thing. to him say i. 
o taipan_ i be a poor person from calcutta and the liveliness of your place astound me. how be it that every one smell of money. whence come your municipal improvement. and why be the white men so restless. 
say the taipan. it be because the island be go ahead mightily. because everything pay. observe this share list. 
he take me down a list of thirty or le company steam launch company mine rope weave dock trade agency and general company and with five exception all the share be at premium some a hundred some five hundred and others only fifty. 
it be not a boom say the taipan. it be genuine. nearly every man you meet in these part be a broke and he float company. 
i look out of the window and behold how company be float. three men with their hat on the back of their head converse for ten minute. to these enter a fourth with a pocket book. then all four dive into the hong kong hotel for material wherewith to float themselves and there be your company. 
from these thing say the taipan_ come the wealth of hong kong. every notion here pay from the dairy farm upwards. we have pass through our bad time and come to the fat year. 
he tell me tale of the old time pityingly because he know i could not understand. all i could tell be that the place dress by america from the hair cutter saloon to the liquor bar. the face of men be turn to the golden gate even while they float most of the singapur company. there be not sufficient push in singapur alone so hong kong help. circular of new company lay on the bank counter. i move amid a maze of interest that i could not comprehend and speak to men whose mind be at hankow foochoo amoy or even further beyond the yangtze gorge where the englishman trade. 
after a while i escape from the company floater because i know i could not understand them and run up a hill. hong kong be all hill except when the fog shut out everything except the sea. tree fern sprout on the grind and azalea mix with the fern and there be bamboo over all. consequently it be only natural that i should find a tramway that stand on it head and wave it foot in the mist. they call it the victoria gap tramway and haul it up with a rope. it run up a hill into space at an angle of ¬∞ and to those who have see the rigi mount washington a switchback railway and the like would not have be impressive. but neither you nor i have ever be haul from annandale to the chaura maid√†n in a bee line with a five hundred foot drop on the off side and we be at liberty to marvel. it be not proper to run up incline way at the tail of a string more especially when you cannot see two yard in front of you and all earth below be a swirl cauldron of mist. nor unless you be warn of the opticalness of the delusion be it nice to see from your seat house and tree at magic lantern angle. such thing before tiffin be bad than the long roll of the china sea. 
they turn me out twelve hundred foot above the city on the military road to dalhousie a it will be when india ha a surplus. then they bring me a glorify dandy which not know any good they call a chair. except that it be too long to run corner easily a chair be vastly superior to a dandy. it be more like a bombay side tonjon the kind we use at mahableshwar. you sit in a wicker chair sling low on ten foot of elastic wooden shaft and there be light blind against the rain. 
we be now say the professor a he wring out his hat gemmed with the dew of the drive mist we be now on a pleasure trip. this be the road to chakrata in the rain. 
nay say i. it be from solon to kasauli that we be go. look at the black rock. 
bosh. say the professor. this be a civilise country. look at the road look at the railing look at the gutter. 
and a i hope never to go to solon again the road be cement the railing be of iron mortise into granite block and the gutter be pave. twas no wide than a hill path but if it have be the viceroy s pet promenade it could not have be good keep. there be no view. that be why the professor have take his camera. we pass cooly widen the road and house shut up and desert solid squat little house make of stone with pretty name after our hill station custom townend craggylands and the like and at these thing my heart burn within me. hong kong ha no right to mix itself up with mussoorie in this fashion. we come to the meet place of the wind eighteen hundred foot above all the world and saw forty mile of cloud. that be the peak the great view place of the island. a laundry on a wash day would have be more interest. 
let u go down professor say i and we ll get our money back. this isn t a view. 
we descend by the marvellous tramway each pretend to be a little upset a the other and start in pursuit of a chinese bury grind. 
go to the happy valley say an expert. the happy valley where the racecourse and the cemetery be. 
it s mussoorie say the professor. i know it all along. 
it be mussoorie though we have to go through a half mile of portsmouth hard first. soldier grin at u from the verandah of their most solid three storied barrack. all the blue jacket of all the china squadron be congregate in the royal navy seaman s club and they beam upon u. the bluejacket be a beautiful creature and very healthy but. i give my heart to thomas atkins long ago and him i love. 
by the way how be it that a highland regiment the argyll and southerlandshire for instance get such good recruit. do the kilt and sporran bring in brawny youngster of five foot nine and thirty nine inch round the chest. the navy draw well build men also. how be it that our infantry regiment fare so badly. 
we come to the happy valley by way of a monument to certain dead englishman. such thing cease to move emotion after a little while. they be but the seed of the great harvest whereof our child s child shall assuredly reap the fruit. the men be kill in a fight or by disease. we hold hong kong and by our strength and wisdom it be a great city build upon a rock and furnish with a dear little seven furlong racecourse set in the hill and fringe a to one side with the home of the dead mahometan christian and parsee. a wall of bamboo shut off the course and the grand stand from the cemetery. it may be good enough for hong kong but would you care to watch your pony run with a grim reminder of go to the drawer not fifty foot behind you. very beautiful be the cemetery and very carefully tend. the rocky hillside rise so near to them that the more recent dead can almost command a view of the race a they lie. even this far from the strife of the church they bury the different sect of christian apart. one creed paint it wall white and the other blue. the latter a close to the race stand a may be write in straggle letter _hodie mihi cras tibi. no i should not care to race in hong kong. the scornful assemblage behind the grand stand would be enough to ruin any luck. 
chinaman do not approve of show their cemetery. we hunt ours from ledge to ledge of the hillside through crop and wood and crop again till we come to a village of black and white pig and rive red rock beyond which the dead lay. it be a third rate place but be pretty. i have study that oilskin mystery the chinaman for at least five day and why he should elect to be bury in good scenery and by what mean he know good scenery when he see it i cannot fathom. but he get it when the sight be take from him and his friend fire cracker above him in token of the triumph. 
that night i din with the taipan in a palace. they say the merchant prince of calcutta be dead kill by exchange. hong kong ought to be able to supply one or two sample. the funny thing in the midst of all this wealth wealth such a one read about in novel be to hear the curious deference that be pay to calcutta. console yourselves with that gentleman of the ditch for by my faith it be the one thing that you can boast of. at this dinner i learn that hong kong be impregnable and that china be rapidly import twelve and forty ton gun for the defence of her coast. the one statement i doubt but the other be truth. those who have occasion to speak of china in these part do so deferentially a who should say. germany intend such and such or these be the view of russia. the very men who talk thus be do their best to force upon the great empire all the stimulant of the west railway tram line and so forth. what will happen when china really wake up run a line from shanghai to lhassa start another line of imperial yellow flag immigrant steamer and really work and control her own gun factory and arsenal. the energetic englishman who ship the forty tonners be help to this end but all they say be. we re well pay for what we do. there s no sentiment in business and anyhow china will never go to war with england. indeed there be no sentiment in business. the taipan s palace full of all thing beautiful and flower more lovely than the gem like cabinet they adorn would have make happy half a hundred young men crave for luxury and might have make them writer singer and poet. it be inhabit by men with big head and straight eye who sit among the splendour and talk business. 
if i be not go to be a burman when i die i would be a taipan at hong kong. he know so much and he deal so largely with prince and power and he ha a flag of his very own which he pin on to all his steamer. 
the bless chance that look after traveller send me next day on a picnic and all because i happen to wander into the wrong house. this be quite true and very like our anglo indian way of do thing. 
perhaps say the host this will be our only fine day. let u spend it in a steam launch. 
forthwith we embark upon a new world that of hong kong harbour and with a dramatic regard for the fitness of thing our little ship be the pioneer. the picnic include the new general he that come from england in the nawab and tell me about lord wolseley and his aide de camp who be quite english and altogether different from an indian officer. he never once talk shop and if he have a grievance hide it behind his mustache. 
the harbour be a great world in itself. photograph say that it be lovely and this i can believe from the glimpse catch through the mist a the pioneer work her way between the line of junk the tether liner the wallow coal hulk the trim low lie american corvette the orontes_ huge and ugly the cockchafer_ almost a small a it namesake the ancient three decker convert into a military hospital thomas get change of air thus and a few hundred thousand sampan man by woman with baby tie on to their back. then we sweep down the sea face of the city and saw that it be great till we come to an unfinished fort high up on the side of a green hill and i watch the new general a men watch an oracle. have i tell you that he be an engineer general specially send out to attend to the fortification. he look at the raw earth and the granite masonry and there be keen professional interest in his eye. perhaps he would say something. i edge near in that hope. he do. 
sherry and sandwich. thank i will. stonishing how hungry the sea air make a man feel quoth the general. and we go along under the grey green coast look at stately country house make of granite where jesuit father and opulent merchant dwell. it be the mashobra of this simla. it be also the highland it be also devonshire and it be specially grey and chilly. 
never do pioneer circulate in strange water. on the one side be a bewilder multiplicity of islet. on the other the deeply indent shore of the main island sometimes run down to the sea in little sandy cove at others fall sheer in cliff and sea wear cave full of the boom of the breaker. behind rise the hill into the mist the everlasting mist. 
we be go to aberdeen say the host. then to stanley and then across the island on foot by way of the ti tam reservoir. that will show you a lot of the country. 
we shoot into a fiord and discover a brown fish village which keep sentry over two dock and a sikh policeman. all the inhabitant be rosy cheek woman each own one third of a boat and a whole baby wrap up in red cloth and tie to the back. the mother be dress in blue for a reason if her husband whack her over the shoulder he would run a fair chance of crush the baby s head unless the infant be of a distinct colour. 
then we leave china altogether and steam into far lochaber with a climate to correspond. good people under the punkah think for a moment of cloud veil headland run out into a steel grey sea crisp with a cheek rasp breeze that make you sit down under the bulwark and gasp for breath. think of the merry pitch and roll of a small craft a it buzz from island to island or venturously cut across the mouth of a mile wide bay while you mature amid fresh scenery fresh talk and fresh face an appetite that shall uphold the credit of the great empire in a strange land. once more we find a village which they call stanley. but it be different from aberdeen. tenantless building of brownstone star seaward from the low down and there lay behind them a stretch of weather beat wall. no need to ask what these thing mean. they cry aloud. it be a desert cantonment and the population be in the cemetery. 
i ask what regiment. 
the ninety second i think say the general. but that be in the old time in the sixty. i believe they quarter a lot of troop here and build the barrack on the grind. and the fever carry all the men off like fly. isn t it a desolate place. 
my mind go back to a neglect graveyard a stone s throw from jehangir s tomb in the garden of shalimar where the cattle and the cowherd look after the last rest place of the troop who first occupy lahore. we be a great people and very strong but we build our empire in a wasteful manner on the bone of the dead that have die of disease. 
but about the fortification general. be it true that etc. etc. 
the fortification be right enough a thing go. what we want be men. 
how many. 
say about three thousand for the island enough to stop any expedition that might come. look at all these little bay and cove. there be twenty place at the back of the island where you could land men and make thing unpleasant for hong kong. 
but i venture isn t it the theory that any organise expedition ought to be stop by our fleet before it get here. whereas the fort be suppose to prevent cut out shell and ransom by a disconnect man of war or two. 
if you go on that theory say the general the men of war ought to be stop by our fleet too. that s all nonsense. if any power can throw troop here you want troop to turn em out and don t we wish we may get them. 
and you. your command here be for five year isn t it. 
oh no. eighteen month ought to see me out. i don t want to stick here for ever. i ve other notion for myself say the general scramble over the boulder to get at his tiffin. 
and that be just the bad of it. here be a nice general help to lay out fortification with one eye on hong kong and the other his right one on england. he would be more than human not to sell himself and his order for the command of a brigade in the next english affair. he would be afraid of be too long away from home l he should drop out of the run and. well we be just the same in india and there be not the least hope of raise a legion of the lose for colonial service of men who would do their work in one place for ever and look for nothing beyond it. but remember that hong kong with five million ton of coal five mile of ship dock wharf huge civil station forty million pound of trade and the nice picnic party that you ever do see want three thousand men and she win t get them. she ha two battery of garrison artillery a regiment and a lot of gun lascar about enough to prevent the gun from rust on their carriage. there be three fort on an island stonecutter s island between hong kong and the mainland three on hong kong itself and three or four scatter about elsewhere. naturally the full complement of gun ha not arrive. even in india you cannot man fort without train gunner. but tiffin under the lee of a rock be more interest than colonial defence. a man cannot talk politics if he be empty. 
our one fine day shut in upon the empty plate in wind and rain and the march across the island begin. 
a the launch be blot out in the haze we squelch past sugar cane crop and fat pig past the bleak cemetery of dead soldier on the hill across a section of moor till we strike a hill road above the sea. the view shift and change like a kaleidoscope. first a shaggy shoulder of land tufted with drip rush and naught above beneath or around but mist and the straight spike of the rain. then red road sweep by water that fell into the unknown. then a combe straight wall almost a a house at the bottom of which crawl the jade green sea. then a vista of a bay a bank of white sand and a red sail junk beat out before the squall. then only wet rock and fern and the voice of thunder call from peak to peak. 
a landward turn in the road bring u to the pine wood of theog and the rhododendron but they call them azalea of simla and ever the rain fell a though it have be july in the hill instead of april at hong kong. an invade army march upon victoria would have a sad time of it even if the rain do not fall. there be but one or two gap in the hill through which it could travel and there be a scheme in preparation whereby they shall be cut off and annihilate when they come. when i have to climb a clay hill backwards dig my heel into the dirt i very much pity that invade army. 
whether the granite face reservoir and two mile tunnel that supply hong kong with water be worth see i cannot tell. there be too much water in the air for comfort even when one try to think of home. 
but go you and take the same walk ten mile and only two of em on level grind. steam to the forsake cantonment of stanley and cross the island and tell me whether you have see anything so wild and wonderful in it way a the scenery. i be go up the river to canton and cannot stay for word painting.

show how i come to goblin market and take a scunner at it and curse the chinese people. show further how i initiate all hong kong into our fraternity. 
providence be please to be sarcastic. it send rain and a raw wind from the begin till the end. that be one of the disadvantage of leave india. you cut yourself adrift from the only trustworthy climate in the world. i despise a land that ha to waste half it time in watch the cloud. the canton trip. i have be that way. introduce you to the american river steamer which be not in the least like one of the irrawaddy flotilla or an omnibus a many people believe. it be compose almost entirely of white paint sheet lead a cow horn and a walk beam and hold about a much cargo a a p. and o. the trade between canton and hong kong seem to be immense and a steamer cover the ninety mile between port and port daily. none the le be the chinese passenger daily put under hatch or it equivalent after they leave port and daily be the stand of load sniders in the cabin inspect and clean up. daily too i should imagine the captain of each boat tell his globe trot passenger the venerable story of the loot of a river steamer how two junk foul her at a convenient bend in the river while the native passenger on her rise and make thing very lively for the crew and end by clear out that steamer. the chinese be a strange people. they have a difficulty at hong kong not very long ago about photograph labour cooly and in the excitement which be considerable a rickety old war junk get into position off the bund with the avow intention of put a three pound shoot through the window of the firm who have suggest the photograph. and this though vessel and crew could have be blow in cigarette ash in ten minute. 
but no one pirate the ho nam_ though the passenger do their best to set her on fire by upset the lamp of their opium pipe. she blare her unwieldy way across the pack ship of the harbour and run into grey mist and drive rain. when i say that the scenery be like the west highland you will by this time understand what i mean. large screw steamer china pig boat very low in the water and choke with live stock wallow junk and duck sampan fill the waterway of a stream a broad a the hughli and much good defend so far a the art of man be concern. their little difficulty with the french a few year ago ha teach the chinese a great many thing which perhaps it be good for u that they have leave alone. 
the first strike object of canton city be the double tower of the big catholic church. take off your hat to this because it mean a great deal and stand a the visible standard of a battle that ha yet to be fight. never have the missionary of the mother of the church wrestle so mightily with any land a with china and never ha nation so scientifically torture the missionary a ha china. perhaps when the book be audit somewhere else each race the white and the yellow will be find to have be right accord to their light. 
i have take one fair look at the city from the steamer and throw up my card. i can t describe this place and besides i hate chinaman. 
bosh. it be only benares magnify about eight time. come along. 
it be benares without any wide street or chauks and yet dark than benares in that the little skyline be entirely block by tier on tier of hang sign red gold black and white. the shop stand on granite plinth pukka brick above and tile roof. their front be carve wood gild and colour savagely. john know how to dress a shop though he may sell nothing more lovely than smash fowl and chitterlings. every other shop be a restaurant and the space between them cram with humanity. do you know those horrible sponge full of worm that grow in warm sea. you break off a piece of it and the worm break too. canton be that sponge. hi low yah. to hoh wang. yell the chair bearer to the crowd but i be afraid that if the pole chip the corner of a house the very brick would begin to bleed. hong kong show me how the chinaman could work. canton explain why he set no value on life. the article be cheap than in india. i hat the chinaman before. i hat him doubly a i choke for breath in his seethe street where nothing short of the pestilence could clear a way. there be of course no incivility from the people but the mere mob be terrify. there be three or four place in the world where it be best for an englishman to agree with his adversary swiftly whatever the latter s nationality may be. canton head the list. never argue with anybody in canton. let the guide do it for you. then the stink rise up and overwhelm u. in this respect canton be benares twenty time magnify. the hindu be a sanitate saint compare to the chinaman. he be a rigid malthusian in the same regard. 
very bad stink this place. you come right along say ah cum who have learn his english from american. he be very kind. he show me feather jewellery shop where men sit pinch from the gorgeous wing of jay tiny square of blue and lilac feather and paste them into gold setting so that the whole look like jeypore enamel of the rare. but we go into a shop. ah cum draw u inside the big door and bolt it while the crowd block up the window and shutter bar. i think more of the crowd than the jewellery. the city be so dark and the people be so very many and so unhuman. 
the march of the mongol be a pretty thing to write about in magazine. hear it once in the gloom of an ancient curio shop where nameless devil of the chinese creed make mouth at you from back shelf where brazen dragon revelation of uncleanliness all catch your foot a you stumble across the floor hear the tramp of the foot on the granite block of the road and the break wave of human speech that be not human. watch the yellow face that glare at you between the bar and you will be afraid a i be afraid. 
it s beautiful work say the professor bend over a cantonese petticoat a wonder of pale green blue and silver. now i understand why the civilise european of irish extraction kill the chinaman in america. it be justifiable to kill him. it would be quite right to wipe the city of canton off the face of the earth and to exterminate all the people who run away from the shell. the chinaman ought not to count. 
i have go off on my own train of think and it be a black and bitter one. 
why on earth can t you look at the lion and enjoy yourself and leave politics to the men who pretend to understand em. say the professor. 
it s no question of politics i reply. this people ought to be kill off because they be unlike any people i ever meet before. look at their face. they despise u. you can see it and they aren t a bite afraid of u either. 
then ah cum take u by way that be dark to the temple of the five hundred genius which be one of the sight of the rabbit warren. this be a buddhist temple with the usual accessory of altar and altar light and colossal figure of doorkeeper at the gate. round the inner court run a corridor line on both side with figure about half life size represent most of the race of asia. several of the jesuit father be say to be in that gallery you can find it all in the guide book and there be one image of a jolly look soul in a hat and full beard but like the others naked to the waist. that european gentleman say ah cum. that marco polo. make the most of him i say. the time be come when there will be no european gentleman nothing but yellow people with black heart black heart ah cum and a devil bear capacity for do more work than they ought. 
come and see a clock say he. old clock. it run by water. come on right along. he take u to another temple and show u an old water clock of four gurrahs. just the same sort of thing a they have in out of the way part of india for the use of the watchman. the professor vow that the machine which be suppose to give the time to the city be regulate by the bell of the steamer in the river canton water be too thick to run through anything small than a half inch pipe. from the pagoda of this temple we could see that the roof of all the house below be cover with fill water jar. there be no sort of fire organisation in the city. when light it burn till it stop. 
ah cum lead u to the potter s field where the execution take place. the chinese slay by the hundred and far be it from me to say that such generosity of bloodshed be cruel. they could afford to execute in canton alone at the rate of ten thousand a year without disturb the steady flow of population. an executioner who happen to be wander about perhaps in search of employment offer u a sword under guarantee that it have cut off many head. keep it i say. keep it and let the good work go on. my friend you cannot execute too freely in this land. you be bless i apprehend with a purely literary bureaucracy recruit correct me if i be wrong from all social stratum more especially those in which the idea of cold blood cruelty ha a it be become embed. now when to inherit devildom be superadded a purely literary education of grim and formal tendency the result my evil look friend the result i repeat be a state of affair which be faintly indicate in the little pilgrim s account of the hell of selfishness. you i presume have not yet read the work of the little pilgrim. 
he look a if he be go to cut at you with that sword say the professor. come away and see the temple of horror. 
that be a sort of chinese madame tussaud s life like model of men be bray in mortar slice fry toast stuff and variously bedevil that make me sick and unhappy. but the chinese be merciful even in their torture. when a man be grind in a mill he be accord to the model pop in head first. this be hard on the crowd who be wait to see the fun but it save trouble to the executioner. a half grind man ha to be carefully watch or else he wriggle out of his place. to crown all we go to the prison which be a pest house in a back street. the professor shudder. it s all right i say. the people who send the prisoner here don t care. the men themselves look hideously miserable but i suppose they don t care and goodness know i don t care. they be only chinaman. if they treat each other like dog why should we regard em a human being. let em rot. i want to get back to the steamer. i want to get under the gun of hong kong. phew. 
then we run through a succession of second rate street and house till we reach the city wall on the west by a long flight of step. it be clean here. the wall have a drop of thirty or forty foot to paddy field. beyond these be a semicircle of hill every square yard of which be plant out with graf. her dead watch canton the abominable and the dead be more than the myriad live. on the grass grow top of the wall be rusty english gun spike and abandon after the war. they ought not to be there. a five storied pagoda give u a view of the city but i be weary of these rat in their pit weary and scar and sullen. the excellent ah cum lead u to the viceroy s summer garden house on the cityward slope of an azalea cover hill surround by cotton tree. the basement be a handsome joss house. upstairs be a durbar hall with glaze verandah and ebony furniture range across the room in four straight line. it be only an oasis of cleanliness. ten minute late we be back in the swarm city cut off from light and sweet air. once or twice we meet a mandarin with thin official mustache and little red button a top. ah cum be explain the nature and property of a mandarin when we come to a canal span by an english bridge and close by an iron gate which be in charge of a hong kong policeman. we be in an indian station with europe shop and parsee shop and everything else to match. this be english canton with two hundred and fifty sahib in it. twould have be good for a gatling behind the bridge gate. the guide book tell you that it be take from the chinese by the treaty of the french get a similar slice of territory. owe to the bind power of french officialism la concession fran√ßaise ha never be let or sell to private individual and now a chinese regiment squat on it. the men who travel tell you somewhat similar tale about land in saigon and cambodia. something seem to attack a frenchman a soon a he don a colonial uniform. let u call it the red tape worm. 
now where do you go and what do you see. say the professor in the style of the pedagogue when we be once more on the ho nam and return a fast a steam could carry u to hong kong. 
a big blue sink of a city full of tunnel all dark and inhabit by yellow devil a city that dor√© ought to have see. i m devoutly thankful that i m never go back there. the mongol will begin to march in his own good time. i intend to wait until he march up to me. let u go away to japan by the next boat. 
the professor say that i have completely spoil the forego account by what he call intemperate libel on a hard work nation. he do not see canton a i saw it through the medium of a fevered imagination. 
once before i get away i climb to the civil station of hong kong which overlook the town. there in sumptuous stone villa build on the edge of the cliff and face shade road in a wilderness of beautiful flower and a hush calm unvexed even by the roar of the traffic below the resident do their best to imitate the life of an india up country station. they be good off than we be. at the bandstand the lady dress all in one piece shoe glove and umbrella come out from england with the dress and every memsahib know what that mean but the mechanism of their life be much the same. in one point they be superior. the lady have a club of their very own to which i believe men be only allow to come on sufferance. at a dance there be about twenty men to one lady and there be practically no spinster in the island. the inhabitant complain of be cooped in and shut up. they look at the sea below them and they long to get away. they have their at home on regular day of the week and everybody meet everybody else again and again. they have amateur theatrical and they quarrel and all the men and woman take side and the station be cleave asunder from the top to the bottom. then they become reconcile and write to the local paper condemn the local critic s criticism. isn t it touch. a lady tell me these thing one afternoon and i nearly weep from sheer home sickness. 
and then you know after she have say that he be oblige to give the part to the other and that make them furious and the race be so near that nothing could be do and mr. say that it be altogether impossible. you understand how very unpleasant it must have be do you not. 
madam say i i do. i have be there before. my heart go out to hong kong. in the name of the great indian mofussil i salute you. henceforward hong kong be one of u rank before meerut but after allahabad at all public ceremony and parade. 
i think she fancy i have sunstroke. but you at any rate will know what i mean. 
we do not laugh any more on the p. and o. s. s. ancona on the way to japan. we be deathly sick because there be a cross sea beneath u and a wet sail above. the sail be to steady the ship who refuse to be steady. she be full of globe trotter who also refuse to be steady. a globe trotter be extreme cosmopolitan. he will be sick anywhere. 
no. xi. 
of japan at ten hour sight contain a complete account of the manner and custom of it people a history of it constitution product art and civilisation and omit a meal in a tea house with o toyo. 
thou canst not wave thy staff in air or dip thy paddle in the lake but it carve the bow of beauty there and ripple in rhyme the oar forsake. emerson. 
this morning after the sorrow of the roll night my cabin porthole show me two great grey rock stud and streak with green and crown by two stunt blue black pine. below the rock a boat that might have be carve sandal wood for colour and delicacy be shake out an ivory white frilled sail to the wind of the morning. an indigo blue boy with an old ivory face haul on a rope. rock and tree and boat make a panel from a japanese screen and i saw that the land be not a lie. this good brown earth of ours ha many pleasure to offer her child but there be few in her gift comparable to the joy of touch a new country a completely strange race and manner contrary. though library may have be write aforetime each new beholder be to himself another cortez. and i be in japan the japan of cabinet and joinery gracious folk and fair manner. japan whence the camphor and the lacquer and the shark skin sword come. among what be it the book say. a nation of artist. to be sure we should only stop at nagasaki for twelve hour ere go on to kob√© but in twelve hour one can pack away a very fair collection of new experience. 
an execrable man meet me on the deck with a pale blue pamphlet fifty page thick. have you say he see the constitution of japan. the emperor make it himself only the other day. it be on entirely european line. 
i take the pamphlet and find a complete paper constitution stamp with the imperial chrysanthemum an excellent little scheme of representation reform payment of member budget estimate and legislation. it be a terrible thing to study at close quarter because it be so pitifully english. 
there be a yellow shoot greenness upon the hill round nagasaki different so my will mind be dispose to believe from the green of other land. it be the green of a japanese screen and the pine be screen pine. the city itself hardly show from the crowd harbour. it lay low among the hill and it business face a grimy bund be sloppy and desert. business i be rejoice to learn be at a low ebb in nagasaki. the japanese should have no concern with business. close to one of the still wharf lay a ship of the bad people. a russian steamer down from vladivostok. her deck be cumber with raffle of all kind. her rig be a frowsy and draggle a the hair of a lodge house slavey and her side be filthy. 
that say a man of my people be a very fair specimen of a russian. you should see their men of war. they be just a filthy. some of em come into nagasaki to clean. 
it be a small piece of information and perhaps untrue but it put the roof to my good humour a i step on to the bund and be tell in faultless english by a young gentleman with a plat chrysanthemum in his forage cap and badly fit german uniform on his limb that he do not understand my language. he be a japanese custom official. have our stay be long i would have weep over him because he be a hybrid partly french partly german and partly american a tribute to civilisation. all the japanese official from police upwards seem to be clothe in europe clothe and never do those clothe fit. i think the mikado make them at the same time a the constitution. they will come right in time. 
when the rickshaw draw by a beautiful apple cheek young man with a basque face shoot me into the mikado_ first act i do not stop and shout with delight because the dignity of india be in my keep. i lay back on the velvet cushion and grin luxuriously at pittising with her sash and three giant hair pin in her blue black hair and three inch clog on her foot. she laugh even a do the burmese girl in the old pagoda at moulmein. and her laugh the laugh of a lady be my welcome to japan. can the people help laugh. i think not. you see they have such thousand of child in their street that the elder must perforce be young l the babe should grieve. nagasaki be inhabit entirely by child. the grow up exist on sufferance. a four foot child walk with a three foot child who be hold the hand of a two foot child who carry on her back a one foot child who but you will not believe me if i say that the scale run down to six inch little jap doll such a they use to sell in the burlington arcade. these doll wriggle and laugh. they be tie up in a blue bed gown which be tie by a sash which again tie up the bed gown of the carrier. thus if you untie that sash baby and but little big brother be at once perfectly naked. i saw a mother do this and it be for all the world like the peel of hard boil egg. 
if you look for extravagance of colour for flame shop front and glare lantern you shall find none of these thing in the narrow stone pave street of nagasaki. but if you desire detail of house construction glimpse of perfect cleanliness rare taste and perfect subordination of the thing make to the need of the maker you shall find all you seek and more. all the roof be dull lead colour be shingle or tile and all the house front be of the colour of the wood a god make it. there be neither smoke nor haze and in the clear light of a cloud sky i could see down the narrow alleyway a into the interior of a cabinet. 
the book have long ago tell you how a japanese house be construct chiefly of slide screen and paper partition and everybody know the story of the burglar of tokio who burgle with a pair of scissor for jimmy and centrebit and steal the consul s trouser. but all the tell in print will never make you understand the exquisite finish of a tenement that you could kick in with your foot and pound to match wood with your fist. behold a bunnia s_[ ] shop. he sell rice and chilli and dry fish and wooden scoop make of bamboo. the front of his shop be very solid. it be make of half inch batten nail side by side. not one of the batten be break. and each one be foursquare perfectly. feel ashamed of himself for this surly bar up of his house he fill one half the frontage with oil paper stretch upon quarter inch frame. not a single square of oil paper ha a hole in it and not one of the square which in more uncivilised country would hold a pane of glass if strong enough be out of line. and the bunnia_ clothe in a blue dress gown with thick white stocking on his foot sit behind not among his ware on a pale gold colour mat of soft rice straw bind with black list at the edge. this mat be two inch thick three foot wide and six long. you might if you be a sufficient pig eat your dinner off any portion of it. the bunnia lie with one wad blue arm round a big brazier of hammer brass on which be faintly delineate in incise line a very terrible dragon. the brazier be full of charcoal ash but there be no ash on the mat. by the bunnia s side be a pouch of green leather tie with a red silk cord hold tobacco cut fine a cotton. he fill a long black and red lacquer pipe light it at the charcoal in the brazier take two whiff and the pipe be empty. still there be no speck on the mat. behind the bunnia be a shadow screen of bead and bamboo. this veil a room floor with pale gold and roof with panel of grain cedar. there be nothing in the room save a blood red blanket lay out smoothly a a sheet of paper. beyond the room be a passage of polish wood so polish that it give back the reflection of the white paper wall. at the end of the passage and clearly visible to this unique bunnia be a dwarf pine two foot high in a green glaze pot and by it side be a branch of azalea blood red a the blanket set in a pale grey crackle pot. the bunnia ha put it there for his own pleasure for the delight of his eye because he love it. the white man ha nothing whatever to do with his taste and he keep his house specklessly pure because he like cleanliness and know it be artistic. what shall we say to such a bunnia.

his brother in northern india may live behind a front of time blacken open work wood but. i do not think he would grow anything save tulsi_[ ] in a pot and that only to please the god and his womenfolk.

let u not compare the two men but go on through nagasaki. 
except for the horrible policeman who insist on be continental the people the common people that be do not run after unseemly costume of the west. the young men wear round felt hat occasionally coat and trouser and semi occasionally boot. all these be vile. in the more metropolitan town men say western dress be rather the rule than the exception. if this be so i be dispose to conclude that the sin of their forefather in make enterprising jesuit missionary into beefsteak have be visit on the japanese in the shape of a partial obscuration of their artistic instinct. yet the punishment seem rather too heavy for the offence. 
then i fell admire the bloom on the people s cheek the three corner smile of the fat babe and the surpass otherness of everything round me. it be so strange to be in a clean land and strange to walk among doll s house. japan be a soothe place for a small man. nobody come to tower over him and he look down upon all the woman a be right and proper. a dealer in curiosity bend himself double on his own door mat and i pass in feel for the first time that i be a barbarian and no true sahib. the slush of the street be thick on my boot and he the immaculate owner ask me to walk across a polish floor and white mat to an inner chamber. he bring me a foot mat which only make matter bad for a pretty girl giggle round the corner a i toil at it. japanese shopkeeper ought not to be so clean. i go into a board passage about two foot wide find a gem of a garden of dwarf tree in the space of half a tennis court whack my head on a fragile lintel and arrive at a four wall daintiness where i involuntarily lower my voice. do you recollect mr. molesworth s cuckoo clock_ and the big cabinet that griselda enter with the cuckoo. i be not griselda but my low voice friend in his long soft wrap be the cuckoo and the room be the cabinet. again i try to console myself with the think that i could kick the place to piece. but this only make me feel large and coarse and dirty a most unfavourable mood for bargain. the cuckoo man cause pale tea to be bring just such tea a you read of in book of travel and the tea complete my embarrassment. what i want to say be look here you person. you re much too clean and refine for this life here below and your house be unfit for a man to live in until he ha be teach a lot of thing which i have never learn. consequently i hate you because i feel myself your inferior and you despise me and my boot because you know me for a savage. let me go or i ll pull your house of cedar wood over your ear. what i really say be oh ah yes. awf ly pretty. awful queer way of do business. 
the cuckoo man prove to be a horrid extortioner. but i be hot and uncomfortable till i get outside and be a bog trot briton once more. you have never blunder into the inside of a three hundred dollar cabinet therefore you will not understand me. 
we come to the foot of a hill a it might have be the hill on which the shway dagon stand and up that hill run a mighty flight of grey weather darken step span here and there by monolithic torii. every one know what a torii be. they have them in southern india. a great king make a note of the place where he intend to build a huge arch but be a king doe so in stone not ink sketch in the air two beam and a cross bar forty or sixty foot high and twenty or thirty wide. in southern india the cross bar be hump in the middle. in the further east it flare up at the end. this description be hardly accord to the book but if a man begin by consult book in a new country he be lose. over the step hang heavy blue green or green black pine old gnarl and boss. the foliage of the hillside be a light green but the pine set the keynote of colour and the blue dress of the few folk on the step answer it. there be no sunshine in the air but i vow that sunshine would have spoil all. we climb for five minute i and the professor and the camera and then we turn and saw the roof of nagasaki lie at our foot a sea of lead and dull brown with here and there a smudge of creamy pink to mark the bloom of the cherry tree. the hill round the town be speckle with the rest place of the dead with clump of pine and feathery bamboo. 
what a country. say the professor unstrapping his camera. and have you notice wherever we go there s always some man who know how to carry my kit. the gharri driver at moulmein hand me my stop. the fellow at penang know all about it too. and the rickshaw coolie ha see a camera before. curious isn t it. 
professor say i it s due to the extraordinary fact that we be not the only people in the world. i begin to realise it at hong kong. it s get plain now. i shouldn t be surprise if we turn out to be ordinary human being after all. 
we enter a courtyard where an evil look bronze horse star at two stone lion and a company of child babble among themselves. there be a legend connect with the bronze horse which may be find in the guide book. but the real true story of the creature be that he be make long ago out of the fossil ivory of siberia by a japanese prometheus and get life and many foal whose descendant closely resemble their father. long year have almost eliminate the ivory in the blood but it crop out in creamy mane and tail. and the pot belly and marvellous foot of the bronze horse may be find to this day among the pack pony of nagasaki who carry pack saddle adorn with velvet and red cloth who wear grass shoe on their hind foot and who be make like to horse in a pantomime. 
we could not go beyond this courtyard because a label say no admittance and thus all we saw of the temple be rich brown high roof of blacken thatch break back and back in wave and undulation till they be lose in the foliage. the japanese can play with thatch a men play with model clay but how their light underpinnings can carry the weight of the roof be a mystery to the lay eye. 
we go down the step to tiffin and a half form resolve be shape itself in my heart the while. burma be a very nice place but they eat gnapi there and there be smell and after all the girl weren t so pretty a some others. 
you must take off your boot say y tokai. 
i assure you there be no dignity in sit down on the step of a tea house and struggle with muddy boot. and it be impossible to be polite in your stock foot when the floor under you be a smooth a glass and a pretty girl want to know where you would like tiffin. take at least one pair of beautiful sock with you when you come this way. get them make of embroider sambhur skin of silk if you like. but do not stand a i do in cheap strip brown thing with a darn at the heel and try to talk to a tea girl. 
they lead u three of them and all fresh and pretty into a room furnish with a golden brown bearskin. the tokonoma_ recess aforementioned hold one scroll picture of bat wheel in the twilight a bamboo flower holder and yellow flower. the ceiling be of panel wood with the exception of one strip at the side near the window and this be make of plait shaving of cedar wood mark off from the rest of the ceiling by a wine brown bamboo so polish that it might have be lacquer. a touch of the hand send one side of the room fly back and we enter a really large room with another tokonoma frame on one side by eight or ten foot of an unknown wood bear the same grain a a penang lawyer and above by a stick of unbarked tree set there purely because it be curiously mottle. in this second tokonoma be a pearl grey vase and that be all. two side of the room be of oil paper and the joint of the beam be cover by the brazen image of crab half life size. save for the sill of the tokonoma_ which be black lacquer every inch of wood in the place be natural grain without flaw. outside be the garden fringe with a hedge of dwarf pine and adorn with a tiny pond water smooth stone sink in the soil and a blossom cherry tree. 
they leave u alone in this paradise of cleanliness and beauty and be only a shameless englishman without his boot a white man be always degrade when he go barefoot i wander round the wall try all the screen. it be only when i stoop to examine the sink catch of a screen that i saw it be a plaque of inlay work represent two white crane feed on fish. the whole be about three inch square and in the ordinary course of event would never be look at. the screen hide a cupboard in which all the lamp and candlestick and pillow and sleep bag of the household seem to be store. an oriental nation that can fill a cupboard tidily be a nation to bow down to. upstairs i go by a staircase of grain wood and lacquer into room of rare device with circular window that open on nothing and so be fill with bamboo tracery for the delight of the eye. the passage floor with dark wood shine like ice and i be ashamed. 
professor say i they don t spit. they don t eat like pig. they can t quarrel and a drunken man would reel straight through every portion in the house and roll down the hill into nagasaki. they can t have any child. here i stop. downstairs be full of baby. 
the maiden come in with tea in blue china and cake in a red lacquer bowl such cake a one get at one or two house in simla. we sprawl ungracefully on red rug over the mat and they give u chopstick to separate the cake with. it be a long task. 
be that all. growl the professor. i m hungry and cake and tea oughtn t to come till four o clock. here he take a wedge of cake furtively with his hand. 
they return five of them this time with black lacquer stand a foot square and four inch high. those be our table. they bore a red lacquer bowlful of fish boil in brine and sea anemone. at least they be not mushroom. a paper napkin tie with gold thread enclose our chopstick. and in a little flat saucer lay a smoke crayfish a slice of a compromise that look like yorkshire pudding and taste like sweet omelette and a twist fragment of some translucent thing that have once be alive but be now pickle. they go away but not empty hand for thou oh o toyo didst take away my heart same which i give to the burmese girl in the shway dagon pagoda. 
the professor open his eye a little but say no word. the chopstick demand all his attention and the return of the girl take up the rest. o toyo ebon haired rosy cheek and make throughout of delicate porcelain laugh at me because i devour all the mustard sauce that have be serve with my raw fish and weep copiously till she give me saki from a lordly bottle about four inch high. if you take some very thin hock and try to mull it and forget all about the brew till it be half cold you would get saki. i have mine in a saucer so tiny that i be bold to have it fill eight or ten time and love o toyo none the le at the end. 
after raw fish and mustard sauce come some other sort of fish cook with pickle radish and very slippery on the chopstick. the girl kneel in a semicircle and shriek with delight at the professor s clumsiness for indeed it be not i that nearly upset the dinner table in a vain attempt to recline gracefully. after the bamboo shoot come a basin of white bean in sweet sauce very tasty indeed. try to convey bean to your mouth with a pair of wooden knit needle and see what happen. some chicken cunningly boil with turnip and a bowlful of snow white boneless fish and a pile of rice conclude the meal. i have forget one or two of the course but when o toyo hand me the tiny lacquer japanese pipe full of hay like tobacco i count nine dish in the lacquer stand each dish represent a course. then o toyo and i smoke by alternate pipeful. 
my very respectable friend at all the club and mess have you ever after a good tiffin loll on cushion and smoke with one pretty girl to fill your pipe and four to admire you in an unknown tongue. you do not know what life be. i look round me at that faultless room at the dwarf pine and creamy cherry blossom without at o toyo bubble with laughter because i blow smoke through my nose and at the ring of mikado maiden over against the golden brown bearskin rug. here be colour form food comfort and beauty enough for half a year s contemplation. i would not be a burman any more. i would be a japanese always with o toyo in a cabinet workhouse on a camphor scent hillside. 
heigho. say the professor. there be bad place than this to live and die in. d you know our steamer go at four. let s ask for the bill and get away. 
now i have leave my heart with o toyo under the pine. perhaps i shall get it back at kob√©.

ala for the incompleteness of the write word. there be so much more that i mean to tell you about nagasaki and the funeral procession that i find in her street. you ought to have read about the wail woman in white who follow the dead man shut up in a wooden sedan chair that rock on the shoulder of the bearer while the bronze hue buddhist priest tramp on ahead and the little boy run alongside. 
i have prepare in my mind moral reflection purview of political situation and a complete essay on the future of japan. now i have forget everything except o toyo in the tea garden. 
from nagasaki we the p. and o. steamer be go to kob√© by way of the inland sea. that be to say we have for the last twenty hour be steam through a huge lake stud a far a the eye can reach with island of every size from four mile long and two wide to little cock hat hummock no big than a decent hayrick. messrs. cook and son charge about one hundred rupee extra for the run through this part of the world but they do not know how to farm the beauty of nature. under any sky the island purple amber grey green and black be worth five time the money ask. i have be sit for the last half hour among a knot of whoop tourist wonder how i could give you a notion of them. the tourist of course be indescribable. they say oh my. at thirty second interval and at the end of five minute call one to another. sa ay don t you think it s vurry much the same all along. then they play cricket with a broomstick till an unusually fair prospect make them stop and shout oh my. again. if there be a few more oak and pine on the island the run would be three hundred mile of naini tal lake. but we be not near naini tal. for a the big ship drive down the alley of water i can see the head of the breaker fly ten foot up the side of the echo cliff albeit the sea be dead still. 
now we have come to a stretch so densely populate with island that all look solid grind. we be run through break water throw up by the race of the tide round an outlying reef and apparently be go to hit an acre of solid rock. somebody on the bridge save u and we head out for another island and so on and so on till the eye weary of watch the nose of the ship swing right and leave and the finite human soul which after all cannot repeat oh my. through a chilly even go below. when you come to japan it can be do comfortably in three month or even ten week sail through this marvellous sea and see how quickly wonder sink to interest and interest to apathy. we bring oyster with u from nagasaki. i be much more interest in their appearance at dinner to night than in the shag back starfish of an islet that ha just slide by like a ghost upon the silver grey water awaken under the touch of the ripe moon. yes it be a sea of mystery and romance and the white sail of the junk be silver in the moonlight. but if the steward curry those oyster instead of serve them on the shell all the veil beauty of cliff and water carven rock will not console me. to day be the seventeenth of april i be sit in an ulster under a thick rug with finger so cold i can barely hold the pen. this embolden me to ask how your thermantidotes be work. a mixture of steatite and kerosene be very good for creak crank i believe and if the coolie fall asleep and you wake up in hades try not to lose your temper. i go to my oyster. 
two day late. this come from kob√©. thirty hour from nagasaki. the european portion of which be a raw american town. we walk down the wide naked street between house of sham stucco with corinthian pillar of wood wooden verandah and piazza all stony grey beneath stony grey sky and keep guard over raw green sapling miscall shade tree. in truth kob√© be hideously american in external. even i who have only see picture of america recognise at once that it be portland maine. it life among hill but the hill be all scalp and the general impression be of out of the wayne. yet ere i go further let me sing the praise of the excellent m. begeux proprietor of the oriental hotel upon whom be peace. his be a house where you can dine. he doe not merely fee you. his coffee be the coffee of the beautiful france. for tea he give you peliti cake. but good. and the vin ordinaire which be compris_ be good. excellent monsieur and madame begeux. if the pioneer be a medium for puff i would write a lead article upon your potato salad your beefsteak your fry fish and your staff of highly train japanese servant in blue tights who look like so many small hamlet without the velvet cloak and who obey the unspoken wish. no it should be a poem a ballad of good live. i have eat curry of the rare at the oriental at penang the turtle steak of raffle s at singapur still live in my regretful memory and they give me chicken liver and suck pig in the victoria at hong kong which i will always extol. but the oriental at kob√© be good than all three. remember this and so shall you who come after slide round a quarter of the world upon a sleek and content stomach. 
we be go from kob√© to yokohama by various road. this necessitate a passport because we travel in the interior and do not run round the coast on shipboard. we take a railroad which may or may not be complete a to the middle and we branch off from that railroad complete or not a the notion may prompt. this will be an affair of some twenty day and ought to include forty or fifty mile by rickshaw a voyage on a lake and i believe bedbug. nota bene. when you come to japan stop at hong kong and send on a letter to the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at tokio if you want to travel in the interior of this fairyland. indicate your route a roughly a ever you choose but for your own comfort give the two extreme town you intend to touch. throw in any detail about your age profession colour of hair and the like that may occur to you and ask to have a passport send to the british consulate at kob√© to meet you. allow the man with a long title a week s time to prepare the passport and you will find it at your service when you land. only write distinctly to save your vanity. my paper be address to a mister kyshrig radjerd kyshrig. 
a in nagasaki the town be full of baby and a in nagasaki every one smile except the chinaman. i do not like chinaman. there be something in their face which i could not understand though it be familiar enough. 
the chinaman s a native i say. that s the look on a native s face but the jap isn t a native and he isn t a sahib either. what be it. the professor consider the surge street for a while. 
the chinaman s an old man when he s young just a a native be but the jap be a child all his life. think how grow up people look among child. that s the look that s puzzle you. 
i dare not say that the professor be right but to my eye it seem he speak sooth. a the knowledge of good and evil set it mark upon the face of a grow man of our people so something i do not understand have mark the face of the chinaman. they have no kinship with the crowd beyond that which a man ha to child. 
they be the superior race say the professor ethnologically. 
they can t be. they don t know how to enjoy life i answer immorally. and anyway their art isn t human. 
what doe it matter. say the professor. here s a shop full of the wreck of old japan. let s go in and look. we go in but i want somebody to solve the chinese question for me. it s too large to handle alone. 
we enter the curio shop aforementioned with our hat in our hand through a small avenue of carve stone lantern and wooden sculpture of devil unspeakably hideous to be receive by a smile image who have grow grey among netsukes and lacquer. he show u the banner and insignia of daimios long since dead while our jaw droop in ignorant wonder. he show u a sacred turtle of mammoth size carven in wood down to minute detail. through room after room he lead u the light fade a we go till we reach a tiny garden and a woodwork cloister that run round it. suit of old time armour make face at u in the gloom ancient sword click at our foot quaint tobacco pouch a old a the sword sway to and fro from some invisible support and the eye of a score of batter buddha red dragon jain tirthankars_ and burmese beloos glare at u from over the fence of tattered gold brocade robe of state. the joy of possession life in the eye. the old man show u his treasure from crystal sphere mount in sea wear wood to cabinet on cabinet full of ivory and wood carving and we be a rich a though we own all that lay before u. unfortunately the mere scratch of japanese character be the only clew to the artist s name so i be unable to say who conceive and in creamy ivory execute the old man horribly embarrass by a cuttle fish. the priest who make the soldier pick up a deer for him and laugh to think that the brisket would be his and the burden his companion s. or the dry lean snake coil in derision on a jawless skull mottle with the memory of corruption. or the rabelaisan badger who stand on his head and make you blush though he be not half an inch long. or the little fat boy pound his small brother. or the rabbit that have just make a joke. or but there be score of these note bear of every mood of mirth scorn and experience that sway the heart of man. and by this hand that ha hold half a dozen of them in it palm i wink at the shade of the dead carver. he have go to his rest but he have work out in ivory three or four impression that i have be hunt after in cold print. 
the englishman be a wonderful animal. he buy a dozen of these thing and put them on the top of an overcrowd cabinet where they look like blob of ivory and forget them in a week. the japanese hide them in a beautiful brocade bag or a quiet lacquer box till three congenial friend come to tea. then he take them out slowly and they be look over with appreciation amid quiet chuckle to the deliberative clink of cup and put back again till the mood for inspection return. that be the way to enjoy what we call curio. every man with money be a collector in japan but you shall find no crowd of thing outside the best shop. 
we stay long in the half light of that quaint place and when we go away we grieve afresh that such a people should have a constitution or should dress every tenth young man in european clothe put a white ironclad in kob√© harbour and send a dozen myoptic lieutenant in baggy uniform about the street. 
it would pay u say the professor his head in a clog shop it would pay u to establish an international suzerainty over japan to take away any fear of invasion or annexation and pay the country a much a ever it choose on condition that it simply sit still and go on make beautiful thing while our men learn. it would pay u to put the whole empire in a glass case and mark it hors concours_ exhibit a. 
h mm say i. who s u. 
oh we generally the sahib log all the world over. our workman a few of them can do a good work in certain line but you don t find whole town full of clean capable dainty designful people in europe. 
let s go to tokio and speak to the emperor about it i say. 
let s go to a japanese theatre first say the professor. it s too early in the tour to start serious politics. 
no. xiii. 
the japanese theatre and the story of the thunder cat. treat also of the quiet place and the dead man in the street. 
to the theatre we go through the mud and much rain. internally it be nearly dark for the deep blue of the audience s dress soak up the scanty light of the kerosene lamp. there be no stand room anywhere except next to the japanese policeman who in the cause of moral and the lord chamberlain have a corner in the gallery and four chair all to himself. he be quite four foot eight inch high and napoleon at st. helena could not have fold his arm more dramatically. after some grunt i fear we be upset the principle of the constitution he consent to give u one chair receive in return a burma cheroot which i have every reason to believe blow his little head off. a pit contain fifty row of fifty people and a bond layer of baby with a gallery which might have hold twelve hundred make up the house. the build be a delicate a piece of cabinet work a any of the house. roof floor beam prop verandah and partition be of naked wood and every other person in the house be smoke a tiny pipe and knock out the ash every two minute. then i wish to fly. death by the auto da fe not be anywhere pay for in the tour. but there be no escape by the one little door where pickle fish be be sell between the act. 
yes it s not exactly safe say the professor a the match wink and sputter all round and below. but if that curtain catch that naked light on the stage or you see this matchwood gallery begin to blaze i ll kick out the back of the refreshment buffet and we can walk away. 
with this warm comfort the drama begin. the green curtain drop from above and be whisk away and three gentleman and a lady open the ball by a dialogue conduct in tone between a burble and a falsetto whisper. if you wish to know their costume look at the near japanese fan. real jap of course be like men and woman but stage jap in their stiff brocade be line for line a jap be draw. when the four sit down a little boy run among them and settle their drapery pull out a sash bow here display a skirt fold there. the costume be a gorgeous a the plot be incomprehensible. but we will call the play _the thunder cat_ or harlequin bag o bone and the amaze old woman_ or the mammoth radish_ or the superfluous badger and the swing light. 
a two sworded man in the black and gold brocade rise up and imitate the gait of an obscure actor call henry irving whereat not know that he be serious i cackle aloud till the japanese policeman look at me austerely. then the two sworded man woo the japanese fan lady the other character comment on his proceeding like a greek chorus till something perhaps a misplace accent provoke trouble and the two sworded man and a vermilion splendour enjoy a vincent crummles fight to the music of all the orchestra one guitar and something that click not castanets. the small boy remove their weapon when the men have sufficiently war and conceive that the piece want light fetch a ten foot bamboo with a naked candle at the end and hold this implement about a foot from the face of the two sworded man follow his every movement with the anxious eye of a child intrust with a typewriter. then the japanese fan girl consent to the woo of the two sworded man and with a scream of eldritch laughter turn into a hideous old woman a boy take off her hair but she do the rest herself. at this terrible moment a gild thunder cat which be a cat issue from a cloud run on wire from the fly to the centre of the gallery and a boy with a badger s tail mock at the two sworded man. then i know that the two sworded man have offend a cat and a badger and would have a very bad time of it for these two animal and the fox be to this day black sorcerer. fearful thing follow and the scenery be change once every five minute. the pretty effect be secure by a double row of candle hang on string behind a green gauze far up the stage and set swing with opposite motion. this besides give a fine idea of uncanniness make one member of the audience sea sick. 
but the two sworded man be far more miserable than i. the bad thunder cat cast such spell upon him that i give up try to find out what he mean to be. he be a fat face low comedian king of the rat assist by other rat and he eat a magic radish with side split pantomime till he become a man once more. then all his bone be take away still by the thunder cat and he fell into a horrid heap illuminate by the small boy with the candle and would not recover himself till somebody speak to a magic parrot and a huge hairy villain and several cooly have walk over him. then he be a girl but hide behind a parasol resume his shape and then the curtain come down and the audience run about the stage and circulate generally. one small boy take it into his head that he could turn head over heel from the prompt side across. with great gravity before the unregarding house he set to work. but roll over sideways with a flourish of chubby leg. nobody care and the polite people in the gallery could not understand why the professor and i be helpless with laughter when the child with a clog for a sword imitate the strut of the two sworded man. the actor change in public and any one who like might help shift scene. why should not a baby enjoy himself if he like. 
a little late we leave. the thunder cat be still work her wicked will on the two sworded man but all would be set right next day. there be a good deal to be do but justice be at the end of it. the man who sell pickle fish and ticket say so. 
good school for a young actor say the professor. he d see what unpruned eccentricity naturally develop into. there s every trick and mannerism of the english stage in that place magnify thirty diameter but perfectly recognisable. how do you intend to describe it. 
the japanese comic opera of the future ha yet to be write i respond grandiloquently. yet to be write in spite of the mikado. the badger ha not yet appear on an english stage and the artistic mask a an accessory to the legitimate drama ha never be utilise. just imagine the thunder cat a a title for a serio comic opera. begin with a domestic cat possess of magic power live in the house of a london tea merchant who kick her. consider. 
the lateness of the hour be the icy answer. to morrow we will go and write opera in the temple close to this place. 
* * * * *. 
to morrow bring fine drizzle rain. the sun by the way ha be hide now for more than three week. they take u to what must be the chief temple of kob√© and give it a name which i do not remember. it be an exasperate thing to stand at the altar of a faith that you know nothing about. there be rite and ceremony of the hindu creed that all have read of and must have witness but in what manner do they pray here who look to buddha and what worship be pay at the shinto shrine. the book say one thing. the eye another. 
the temple would seem to be also a monastery and a place of great peace disturb only by the babble of score of little child. it stand back from the road behind a sturdy wall an irregular mass of steep pitch roof bind fantastically at the crown copper green where the thatch have ripen under the touch of time and dull grey black where the tile run. under the eaves a man who believe in his god and so could do good work have carve his heart into wood till it blossom and break into wave or curl with the ripple of live flame. somewhere on the outskirt of lahore city stand a mazy gather of tomb and cloister walk call chajju bhagat s chubara build no one know when and decay no one care how soon. though this temple be large and spotlessly clean within and without the silence and rest of the place be those of the courtyard in the far off punjab. the priest have make many garden in corner of the wall garden perhaps forty foot long by twenty wide and each though different from it neighbour contain a little pond with goldfish a stone lantern or two hummock of rock flat stone carve with inscription and a cherry or peach tree all blossom. 
stone pave path run across the courtyard and connect build with build. in an inner enclosure where lay the pretty garden of all be a golden tablet ten or twelve foot high against which stand in high relief of hammer bronze the figure of a goddess in flow robe. the space between the pave path here be strew with snowy white pebble and in white pebble on red they have write on the grind how happy. you might take them a you please for the sigh of contentment or the question of despair. 
the temple itself reach by a wooden bridge be nearly dark but there be light enough to show a hundred subdue splendour of brown and gold of silk and faithfully paint screen. if you have once see a buddhist altar where the master of the law sit among golden bell ancient bronze flower in vas and banner of tapestry you will begin to understand why the roman catholic church once prosper so mightily in this country and will prosper in all land where it find an elaborate ritual already exist. an art love folk will have a god who be to be propitiate with pretty thing a surely a a race breed among rock and moor and drive cloud will enshrine their deity in the storm and make him the austere recipient of the sacrifice of the rebellious human spirit. do you remember the story of the bad people of iquique. the man who tell me that yarn tell me another of the good people of somewhere else. they also be simple south american with nothing to wear and have be conduct a service of their own in honour of their god before a black jowled jesuit father. at a critical moment some one forget the ritual or a monkey invade the sanctity of that forest shrine and steal the priest s only garment. anyhow an absurdity happen and the good people burst into shout of laughter and break off to play for a while. 
but what will your god say. ask the jesuit scandalise at the levity. 
oh. he know everything. he know that we forget and can t attend and do it all wrong but he be very wise and very strong be the reply. 
well that doesn t excuse you. 
of course it doe. he just lie back and laugh say the good people of somewhere else and fell to pelt each other with blossom. 
i forget what be the precise bear of this anecdote. but to return to the temple. hide away behind a mass of variegate gorgeousness be a row of very familiar figure with gold crown on their head. one doe not expect to meet krishna the butter thief and kali the husband beater so far east a japan. 
what be these. 
they be other god say a young priest who giggle deprecatingly at his own creed every time he be question about it. they be very old. they come from india in the past. i think they be indian god but i do not know why they be here. 
i hate a man who be ashamed of his faith. there be a story connect with those god and the priest would not tell it to me. so i sniff at him scornfully and go my way. it lead me from the temple straight into the monastery which be all make of delicate screen polish floor and brown wood ceiling. except for my tread on the board there be no sound in the place till i hear some one breathe heavily behind a screen. the priest slide back what have appear to me a dead wall and we find a very old priest half asleep over his charcoal handwarmer. this be the picture. the priest in olive green his bald head pure silver bow down before a slide screen of white oil paper which let in dull silver light. to his right a batter black lacquer stand contain the indian ink and brush with which he feign to work. to the right of these again a pale yellow bamboo table hold a vase of olive green crackle and a sprig of almost black pine. there be no blossom in this place. the priest be too old. behind the sombre picture stand a gorgeous little buddhist shrine gold and vermilion. 
he make a fresh picture for the little screen here every day say the young priest point first to his senior and then to a blank little tablet on the wall. the old man laugh pitifully rub his head and hand me his picture for the day. it represent a flood over rocky grind. two men in a boat be help two others on a tree half submerge by the water. even i could tell that the power have go from him. he must have draw well in his manhood for one figure in the boat have action and purpose a it lean over the gunwale. but the rest be blur and the line have wander astray a the poor old hand have quaver across the paper. i have no time to wish the artist a pleasant old age and an easy death in the great peace that surround him before the young man draw me away to the back of the shrine and show me a second small altar face shelf on shelf of little gold and lacquer tablet cover with japanese character. 
these be memorial tablet of the dead he giggle. once and again the priest he pray here for those who be dead you understand. 
perfectly. they call em mass where i come from. i want to go away and think about thing. you shouldn t laugh though when you show off your creed. 
ha ha. say the young priest and i run away down the dark polish passage with the fade screen on either hand and get into the main courtyard face the street while the professor be try to catch temple front with his camera. 
a procession pass four abreast tramp through the sloshy mud. they do not laugh which be strange till i saw and hear a company of woman in white walk in front of a little wooden palanquin carry on the shoulder of four bearer and suspiciously light. they sing a song half under their breath a wail moan song that i have only hear once before from the lip of a native far away in the north of india who have be claw past hope of cure by a bear and be sing his own death song a his friend bore him along. 
have makee die say my rickshaw coolie. few yu ne ral. 
i be aware of the fact. men woman and little child pour along the street and when the death song die down help it forward. the half mourner wear only piece of white cloth about their shoulder. the immediate relative of the dead be in white from head to foot. aho. ahaa. aho. they wail very softly for fear of break the cadence of the fall rain and they disappear. all except one old woman who could not keep pace with the procession and so come along alone croon softly to herself. aho. ahaa. aho. she whisper. 
the little child in the courtyard be cluster round the professor s camera. but one child have a very bad skin disease on his innocent head so bad that none of the others would play with him and he stand in a corner and sob and sob a though his heart would break. poor little gehazi. 
no. xiv. 
explain in what manner i be take to venice in the rain and climb into a devil fort. a tin pot exhibition and a bath. of the maiden and the boltless door the cultivator and his field and the manufacture of ethnological theory at railroad speed. end with kioto. 
there s a deal o fine confuse feedin about sheep s head. 
christopher north. 
come along to osaka say the professor. 
why. i m quite comfy here and we shall have lobster cutlet for tiffin. and anyhow it be rain heavily and we shall get wet. 
sorely against my will for it be in my mind to fudge japan from a guide book while i enjoy the cookery of the oriental at kob√© i be drag into a rickshaw and the rain and convey to a railway station. even the japanese cannot make their railway station lovely though they do their best. their system of baggage book be borrow from the american. their narrow gauge line locos and roll stock be english. their passenger traffic be regulate with the precision of the gaul and the uniform of their official come from the near ragbag. the passenger themselves be altogether delightful. a large number of them be modify european and resemble nothing more than tenniel s picture of the white rabbit on the first page of alice in wonderland. they be dress in neat little tweed suit with fawn colour overcoat and they carry lady reticule of black leather and nickel plating. they wear paper and celluloid stick up collar which must have be quite thirteen inch round the neck and their boot be number four. on their hand their wee wee hand they have white cotton glove and they smoke cigarette from fairy little cigarette case. that be young japan the japan of the present day. 
wah wah god be great say the professor. but it isn t in human nature for a man who sprawl about on soft mat by instinct to wear europe clothe a though they belong to him. if you notice the last thing that they take to be shoe. 
a lapis lazuli colour locomotive which by accident have a mix train attach to it happen to loaf up to the platform just then and we enter a first class english compartment. there be no stupid double roof window shade or abortive thermantidote. it be a london and south western carriage. osaka be about eighteen mile from kob√© and stand at the head of the bay of osaka. the train be allow to go a fast a fifteen mile an hour and to play at the station all along the line. you must know that the line run between the hill and the shore and the drainage fall be a great deal steep than anything we have between saharunpur and umballa. the river and the hill torrent come down straight from the hill on raise bed of their own formation which bed again have to be bunded and span with girder bridge or here perhaps i may be wrong tunnel. 
the station be black tile red wall and concrete floor and all the plant from signal lever to good truck be english. the official colour of the bridge be a yellow brown most like unto a fade chrysanthemum. the uniform of the ticket collector be a peak forage cap with gold line black frock coat with brass button very long in the skirt trouser with black mohair braid and button kid boot. you cannot be rude to a man in such raiment. 
but the countryside be the thing that make u open our eye. imagine a land of rich black soil very heavily manure and work by the spade and hoe almost exclusively and if you split your field. of vision. into half acre plot you will get a notion of the raw material the cultivator work on. but all i can write will give you no notion of the wantonness of neatness visible in the field of the elaborate system of irrigation and the mathematical precision of the plant. there be no mix of crop no waste of boundary in footpath and no difference of value in the land. the water stand everywhere within ten foot of the surface a the well sweep attest. on the slope of the foot hill each drop between the level be neatly rivet with unmortared stone and the edge of the watercuts be face in like manner. the young rice be transplant very much a draught be lay on the board. the tea might have be crop garden box. and between the line of the mustard the water lay in the drill a in a wooden trough while the purple of the bean run up to the mustard and stop a though cut with a rule. 
on the seaboard we saw an almost continuous line of town variegate with factory chimney. inland the crazy quilt of green dark green and gold. even in the rain the view be lovely and exactly a japanese picture have lead me to hope for. only one drawback occur to the professor and myself at the same time. crop don t grow to the full limit of the seed on heavily work grind dot with village except at a price. 
cholera. say i watch a stretch of well sweep. 
cholera say the professor. must be y know. it s all sewage irrigation. 
i felt that i be friend with the cultivator at once. these broad hat blue clothe gentleman who till their field by hand except when they borrow the village buffalo to drive the share through the rice slough know what the scourge mean. 
how much do you think the government take in revenue from vegetable garden of that kind. i demand. 
bosh say he quietly you aren t go to describe the land tenure of japan. look at the yellow of the mustard. 
it lay in sheet round the line. it run up the hill to the dark pine. it riot over the brown sandbar of the swell river and fade away by mile after mile to the shore of the leaden sea. the high peak house of brown thatch stand knee deep in it and it surge up to the factory chimney of osaka. 
great place osaka say the guide. all sort of manufacture there. 
osaka be build into and over and among one thousand eight hundred and ninety four canal river dam and watercuts. what the multitudinous chimney mean i cannot tell. they have something to do with rice and cotton. but it be not good that the jap should indulge in trade and i will not call osaka a great commercial entrepot. people who live in paper house should never sell good a the proverb say. 
because of his many want there be but one hotel for the englishman in osaka and they call it juter s. here the view of two civilisation collide and the result be awful. the build be altogether japanese. wood and tile and slide screen from top to bottom. but the fitment be mix. my room for instance hold a tokonoma_ make of the polish black stem of a palm and delicate woodwork frame a scroll picture represent stork. but on the floor over the white mat lay a brussels carpet that make the indignant toe tingle. from the back verandah one overhang the river which run straight a an arrow between two line of house. they have cabinet maker in japan to fit the river to the town. from my verandah i could see three bridge one a hideous lattice girder arrangement and part of a fourth. we be on an island and own a watergate if we want to take a boat. 
apropos of water be please to listen to a shock story. it be write in all the book that the japanese though cleanly be somewhat casual in their custom. they bathe often with nothing on and together. this notion my experience of the country gather in the seclusion of the oriental at kob√© make me scoff at. i demand a tub at juter s. the infinitesimal man lead me down verandah and upstairs to a beautiful bath house full of hot and cold water and fit with cabinet work somewhere in a lonely out gallery. there be naturally no bolt to the door any more than there would be a bolt to a din room. have i be shelter by the wall of a big europe bath i should not have care but i be prepare to wash when a pretty maiden open the door and indicate that she also would tub in the deep sink japanese bath at my side. when one be dress only in one s virtue and a pair of spectacle it be difficult to shut the door in the face of a girl. she gather that i be not happy and withdraw giggle while i thank heaven blush profusely the while that i have be bring up in a society which unfit a man to bathe √† deux. even an experience of the paddington swim bath would have help me. but come straight from india lady godiva be a ballet girl in sentiment compare to this act√¶on. 
it rain monsoonishly and the professor discover a castle which he need must see. it s osaka castle he say and it ha be fight over for hundred of year. come along. 
i ve see castle in india. raighur jodhpur all sort of place. let s have some more boil salmon. it s good in this station. 
pig say the professor. 
we thread our way over the four thousand and fifty two canal etc. where the little child play with the swiftly run water and never a mother say don t till our rickshaw stop outside a fort ditch thirty foot deep and face with gigantic granite slab. on the far side uprise the wall of a fort. but such a fort. fifty foot be the height of the wall and never a pinch of mortar in the whole. nor be the face perpendicular but curve like the ram of a man of war. they know the curve in china and i have see french artist introduce it into book describe a devil besiege city of tartary. possibly everybody else know it too but that be not my affair. life a i have say be altogether new to me. the stone be granite and the men of old time have use it like mud. the dress block that make the profile of the angle be from twenty foot long ten or twelve foot high and a many in thickness. there be no attempt at bind but there be no fault in the joint. 
and the little jap build this. i cry awe stricken at the quarry that rise round me. 
cyclopean masonry grunt the professor punch with a stick a monolith of seventeen foot cube. not only do they build it but they take it. look at this. fire. 
the stone have be split and bronze in place and the cleavage be the cleavage of fire. evil must it have be for the army that lead the assault on these monstrous wall. castle in india i know and the fort of great emperor i have see but neither akbar in the north nor scindia in the south have build after this fashion without ornament without colour but with a single eye to savage strength and the utmost purity of line. perhaps the fort would have look le forbid in sunlight. the grey rain lade atmosphere through which i saw it suit it spirit. the barrack of the garrison the commandant s very dainty house a peach garden and two deer be foreign to the place. they should have people it with giant from the mountain instead of gurkha. a jap infantryman be not a gurkha though he might be mistake for one a long a he stand still. the sentry at the quarter guard belong i fancy to the th regiment. his uniform be black or blue with red facing and shoulder strap carry the number of the regiment in cloth. the rain necessitate an overcoat but why he should have carry knapsack blanket boot and binoculars i could not fathom. the knapsack be of cowskin with the hair on the boot be strap sol cut on each side while a heavy country blanket be roll u shape over the head of the knapsack fit close to the back. in the place usually occupy by the mess tin be a black leather case shape like a field glass. this must be a mistake of mine but i can only record a i see. the rifle be a side bolt weapon of some kind and the bayonet an uncommonly good sword one lock to the muzzle english fashion. the ammunition pouch a far a i could see under the greatcoat run on the belt in front and be double strap down. white spatterdashes very dirty and peak cap complete the outfit. i survey the man with interest and would have make further examination of him but for fear of the big bayonet. his arm be well keep not speckle by any mean but his uniform would have make an english colonel swear. there be no portion of his body except the neck that it pretend to fit. i peep into the quarter guard. fan and dainty tea set do not go with one s notion of a barrack. one drunken defaulter of certain far away regiment that i could name would not only have clear out that quarter guard but bring away all it fitting except the rifle rack. yet the little men who be always gentle and never get drink be mount guard over a pile that with a blue fire on the bastion might have serve for the guard gate of hell. 
i climb to the top of the fort and be reward by a view of thirty mile of country chiefly pale yellow mustard and blue green pine and the sight of the very large city of osaka fade away into mist. the guide take most pleasure in the factory chimney. there be an exposition here an exposition of industrialities. come and see say he. he take u down from that high place and show u the glory of the land in the shape of corkscrew tin mug egg whisk dipper silk button and all the trumpery that can be stitch on a card and sell for five penny three farthing. the japanese unfortunately make all these thing for themselves and be proud of it. they have nothing to learn from the west a far a finish be concern and by intuition know how to case and mount ware tastefully. the exposition be in four large shed run round a central build which hold only screen pottery and cabinet ware loan for the occasion. i rejoice to see that the common people do not care for the penknife and the pencil and the mock jewellery. they leave those shed alone and discuss the screen first take off their clog that the inlay floor of the room might not suffer. of all the gracious thing i behold two only remain in my memory one a screen in grey represent the head of six devil instinct with malice and hate. the other a bold sketch in monochrome of an old woodcutter wrestle with the down bend branch of a tree. two hundred year have pass since the artist drop his pencil but you may almost hear the tough wood jar under the stroke of the chopper a the old man put his back into the task and draw in the labour breath. there be a picture by legros of a beggar die in a ditch which might have be suggest by that screen. 
next morning after a night s rain which send the river race under the frail balcony at eight mile an hour the sun break through the cloud. be this a little matter to you who can count upon him daily. i have not see him since march and be begin to feel anxious. then the land of peach blossom spread it draggle wing abroad and rejoice. all the pretty maiden put on their lovely cr√™pe sash fawn colour pink blue orange and lilac all the little child pick up a baby each and go out to be happy. in a temple garden full of blossom i perform the miracle of deucalion with two cent worth of sweet. the baby swarm on the instant till for fear of raise all the mother too i forbear to give them any more. they smile and nod prettily and trot after me forty strong the big one help the little and the little one skip in the puddle. a jap child never cry never scuffle never fight and never make mud pie except when it life on the bank of a canal. yet l it should spread it sash bow and become a bald head angel ere it time providence ha decree that it should never never blow it little nose. notwithstanding the defect i love it. 
there be no business in osaka that day because of the sunshine and the bud of the tree. everybody go to a tea house with his friend. i go also but first run along a boulevard by the side of the river pretend to look at the mint. this be only a common place of solid granite where they turn out dollar and rubbish of that kind. all along the boulevard the cherry peach and plum tree pink white and red touch branch and make a belt of velvety soft colour a far a the eye could reach. weep willow be the normal ornament of the waterside this revel of bloom be only part of the prodigality of spring. the mint may make a hundred thousand dollar a day but all the silver in it keep will not bring again the three week of the peach blossom which even beyond the chrysanthemum be the crown and glory of japan. for some act of surpass merit perform in a past life i have be enable to hit those three week in the middle. 
now be the japanese festival of the cherry blossom say the guide. all the people will be festive. they will pray too and go to the tea garden. 
now you might wall an englishman about with cherry tree in bloom from head to heel and after the first day he would begin to complain of the smell. a you know the japanese arrange a good many of their festival in honour of flower and this be surely commendable for blossom be the most tolerant of god. 
the tea house system of the japanese fill me with pleasure at a pleasure that i could not fully comprehend. it pay a company in osaka to build on the outskirt of the town a nine storied pagoda of wood and iron to lay out elaborate garden round it and to hang the whole with string of blood red lantern because the japanese will come wherever there be a good view to sit on a mat and discus tea and sweetmeat and saki. this eiffel tower be to tell the truth anything but pretty yet the surround redeem it. although it be not quite complete the low storey be full of tea stall and tea drinker. the men and woman be obviously admire the view. it be an astound thing to see an oriental so engage. it be a though he have steal something from a sahib. 
from osaka canal cut muddy and fascinate osaka the professor mister yamagutchi the guide and i take train to kioto an hour from osaka. on the road i saw four buffalo at a many rice plough which be noticeable a well a wasteful. a buffalo at rest must cover the half of a japanese field. but perhaps they be keep on the mountain ledge and only pull down when want. the professor say that what i call buffalo be really bullock. the bad of travel with an accurate man be his accuracy. we argue about the japanese in the train about his present and his future and the manner in which he ha range himself on the side of the gross nation of the earth. 
do it hurt his feeling very much to wear our clothe. didn t he rebel when he put on a pair of trouser for the first time. win t he grow sensible some day and drop foreign habit. these be some of the question i put to the landscape and the professor. 
he be a baby say the latter a big baby. i think his sense of humour be at the bottom of the change but he didn t know that a nation which once wear trouser never take em off. you see enlighten japan be only one and twenty year old and people be not very wise at one and twenty. read reed s japan and learn how the change come about. there be a mikado and a shogun who be sir frederick robert but he try to be the viceroy and. 
bother the shogun. i ve see something like the babu class and something like the farmer class. what i want to see be the rajput class the man who use to wear the thousand and thousand of sword in the curio shop. those sword be a much make for use a a rajputana sabre. where be the men who use em. show me a samurai. 
the professor answer not a word but scrutinise head on the wayside platform. i take it that the high arch forehead club nose and eye close together the spanish type be from rajput stock while the german face jap be the khattri the low class. 
thus we talk of the nature and disposition of men we know nothing about till we have decide. that the painful politeness of the japanese nation rise from the habit drop only twenty year ago of extend and emphatic sword wear even a the rajput be the pink of courtesy because his friend go arm. that this politeness will disappear in another generation or will at least be seriously impair. that the culture japanese of the english pattern will corrupt and defile the taste of his neighbour till. japan altogether cease to exist a a separate nation and become a button hook manufacture appanage of america. that these thing be so and sure to happen in two or three hundred year the professor and i be lucky to reach japan betimes. and. that it be foolish to form theory about the country until we have see a little of it. 
so we come to the city of kioto in regal sunshine temper by a breeze that drive the cherry blossom in drift about the street. one japanese town in the southern province at least be very like another to look at a grey black sea of house roof speckle with the white wall of the fire proof godown where merchant and rich men keep their chief treasure. the general level be break by the temple roof which be turn up at the edge and remotely resemble so many terai hat. kioto fill a plain almost entirely surround by wooded hill very familiar in their aspect to those who have see the siwaliks. once upon a time it be the capital of japan and to day number two hundred and fifty thousand people. it be lay out like an american town. all the street run at right angle to each other. that by the way be exactly what the professor and i be do. we be elaborate the theory of the japanese people and we can t agree. 
no. xv. 
kioto and how i fell in love with the chief belle there after i have confer with certain china merchant who traffic in tea. show further how in a great temple i break the tenth commandment in fifty three place and bow down before kano and a carpenter. take me to arashima. 
could i but write the thing i see my world would haste to gaze with me. but since the traitor pen hath fail to paint earth s loveliness unveil i can but pray my folk who read. for lavish will take starveling deed. 
we be consort with sixty of the sahib log in the quaint hotel that ever you saw. it stand on the hillside overlook the whole town of kioto and it garden be veritable japanese. fantastically trim tea tree juniper dwarf pine and cherry be mix up with pond of goldfish stone lantern quaint rock work and velvety turf all at an angle of thirty five degree. behind u the pine red and black cover the hill and run down in a long spur to the town. but an auctioneer s catalogue cannot describe the charm of the place or deal justly with the tea garden full of cherry tree that lie a hundred yard below the hotel. we be solemnly assure that hardly any one come to kioto. that be why we meet every soul in the ship that have bring u to nagasaki. and that be why our ear be constantly assail with the clamour of people who be discuss place which must be do. an englishman be a very horrible person when he be on the war path. so be an american a frenchman or a german. 
i have be watch the afternoon sunlight upon the tree and the town the shift and play of colour in the crowd street of the cherry and croon to myself because the sky be blue and i be alive beneath it with a pair of eye in my head. 
immediately the sun go down behind the hill the air become bitterly cold but the people in cr√™pe sash and silk coat never cease their sober frolic. there be to be a great service in honour of the cherry blossom the next day at the chief temple of kioto and they be get ready for it. a the light die in a wash of crimson the last thing i saw be a frieze of three little japanese baby with fuzzy top knot and huge sash try to hang head downwards from a bamboo rail. they do it and the close eye of day regard them solemnly a it shut. the effect in silhouette be immense. 
a company of china tea merchant be gather in the smoke room after dinner and by consequence talk their own shop which be interest. their language be not our language for they know nothing of the tea garden of dry and wither and roll of the assistant who break his collar bone in the middle of the busy season or of the sickness that smite the coolie line at about the same time. they be happy men who get their tea by the break of a thousand chest from the interior of the country and play with it upon the london market. none the le they have a very wholesome respect for indian tea which they cordially detest. here be the sort of argument that a foochow man himself a very heavy buyer fling at me across the table. 
you may talk about your indian tea assam and kangra or whatever you call them but i tell you that if ever they get a strong hold in england the doctor will be down on them sir. they ll be medically forbid. see if they aren t. they shatter your nerve to piece. unfit for human consumption that s what they be. though i don t deny they be sell at home. they don t keep though. after three month the sort that i ve see in london turn to hay. 
i think you be wrong there say a hankow man. my experience be that the indian tea keep good than ours by a long way. but turn to me if we could only get the china government to take off the duty we could smash indian tea and every one connect with it. we could lay down tea in mince lane at threepence a pound. no we do not adulterate our tea. that s one of your trick in india. we get it a pure a yours every chest in the break equal to sample. 
you can trust your native buyer then. i interrupt. 
trust em. of course we can cut in the foochow merchant. there be no tea garden in china a you understand them. the peasantry cultivate the tea and the buyer buy from them for cash each season. you can give a chinaman a hundred thousand dollar and tell him to turn it into tea of your own particular chop up to sample. of course the man may be a thorough pace rogue in many way but he know good than to play the fool with an english house. back come your tea a thousand half chest we ll say. you open perhaps five and the balance go home untried. but they be all equal to sample. that s business that be. the chinaman s a bear merchant and full of backbone. i like him for business purpose. the jap s no use. he isn t man enough to handle a hundred thousand dollar. very possibly he d run off with it or try to. 
the jap ha no business savvy. god know i hate the chinaman say a bass voice behind the tobacco smoke but you can do business with him. the jap s a little huckster who can t see beyond his nose. 
they call for drink and tell tale these merchant of china tale of money and bale and box but through all their story there be an imply lean upon native help which even allow for the peculiarity of china be rather startle. the compradore do this. ho whang do that. a syndicate of pekin banker do the other thing and so on. i wonder whether a certain lordly indifference a to detail have anything to do with eccentricity in the china tea break and fluctuation of quality which do occur in spite of all the men say to the contrary. again the merchant speak of china a a place where fortune be make a land only wait to be open up to pay a hundredfold. they tell me of the home government help private trade in kind and unobtrusive way to get a firm hold on the public work department contract that be now fly abroad. this be pleasant hear. but the strange thing of all be the tone of hope and almost contentment that pervade their speech. they be well to do men make money and they like their life. you know how when two or three of u be gather together in our own barren pauper land we groan in chorus and be disconsolate. the civilian the military man and the merchant they be all alike. the one overwork and break by exchange the second a highly organise beggar and the third a nobody in particular always at loggerhead with what he consider an academical government. i know in a way that we be a grim and miserable community in india but i do not know the measure of our fall till i hear men talk about fortune success money and the pleasure good live and frequent trip to england that money bring. their friend do not seem to die with unnatural swiftness and their wealth enable them to endure the calamity of exchange with calm. yes we of india be a wretched folk. 
very early in the dawn before the nest sparrow be awake there be a sound in the air which frighten me out of my virtuous sleep. it be a lisp mutter very deep and entirely strange. that s an earthquake and the hillside be begin to slide quoth i take measure of defence. the sound repeat itself again and again till i argue that if it be the precursor of an earthquake the affair have stick half way. at breakfast men say. that be the great bell of kioto just next door to the hotel a little way up the hillside. a a bell y know it s rather a failure from an english point of view. they don t ring it properly and the volume of sound be comparatively insignificant. 
so i fancy when i first hear it i say casually and go out up the hill under sunshine that fill the heart and tree that fill the eye with joy. you know the unadulterated pleasure of that first clear morning in the hill when a month s solid idleness lie before the loafer and the scent of the deodar mix with the scent of the meditative cigar. that be my portion when i step through the violet stud long grass into forget little japanese cemetery all break pillar and lichened tablet till i find under a cut in the hillside the big bell of kioto twenty foot of green bronze hang inside a fantastically roof shed of wooden beam. a beam by the way be a beam in japan. anything under a foot thick be a stick. these beam be the best part of big tree clamp with bronze and iron. a knuckle rap lightly on the lip of the bell it be not more than five foot from the grind make the great monster breathe heavily and the blow of a stick start a hundred shrill voice echo round the darkness of it dome. at one side guy by half a dozen small hawser hang a batter ram a twelve foot spar bind with iron it nose point full butt at a chrysanthemum in high relief on the belly of the bell. then by special favour of providence which always look after the idle they begin to sound sixty stroke. half a dozen men swing the ram back and forth with shouting and outcry till it have gather sufficient way and the loosen rope let it hurl itself against the chrysanthemum. the boom of the smite bronze be swallow up by the earth below and the hillside behind so that it volume be not proportionate to the size of the bell exactly a the men have say. an english ringer would have make thrice a much of it. but then he would have lose the crawl jar that run through rock stone and pine for twenty yard round that beat through the body of the listener and die away under his foot like the shock of a distant blast. i endure twenty stroke and remove myself not in the least ashamed of mistake the sound for an earthquake. many time since i have hear the bell speak when i be far off. it say b r r r very deep down in it throat but when you have once catch the noise you will never forget it. and so much for the big bell of kioto. 
from it house a staircase of cut stone take you down to the temple of chion in where i arrive on easter sunday just before service and in time to see the procession of the cherry blossom. they have a special service at a place call st. peter s at rome about the same time but the priest of buddha excel the priest of the pope. thus it happen. the main front of the temple be three hundred foot long a hundred foot deep and sixty foot high. one roof cover it all and save for the tile there be no stone in the structure. nothing but wood three hundred year old a hard a iron. the pillar that uphold the roof be three foot four foot and five foot in diameter and guiltless of any paint. they show the natural grain of the wood till they be lose in the rich brown darkness far overhead. the cross beam be of grain wood of great richness. cedar wood and camphor wood and the heart of gigantic pine have be put under requisition for the great work. one carpenter they call him only a carpenter have design the whole and his name be remember to this day. a half of the temple be rail off for the congregation by a two foot rail over which silk of ancient device have be throw. within the rail be all the religious fitting but these i cannot describe. all i remember be row upon row of little lacquer stand each hold a roll volume of sacred writing. an altar a tall a a cathedral organ where gold strive with colour colour with lacquer and lacquer with inlay and candle such a holy mother church us only on her great day shed a yellow light that soften all. bronze incense burner in the liken of dragon and devil fume under the shadow of silken banner behind which wood tracery a delicate a frost on a window pane climb to the ridge pole. only there be no visible roof to this temple. the light fade away under the monstrous beam and we might have be in a cave a hundred fathom below the earth but for the sunshine and blue sky at the portal where the little child squabble and shout. 
on my word i try to note down soberly what lay before me but the eye tire and the pencil run off into fragmentary ejaculation. but what would you have do if you have see what i saw when i go round the temple verandah to what we must call a vestry at the back. it be a big build connect with the main one by a wooden bridge of deep time wear brown. down the bridge run a line of saffron colour mat and down the mat very slowly and solemnly a befit their high office file three and fifty priest each one clothe in at least four garment of brocade cr√™pe and silk. there be silk that do not see the light of the market and brocade that only temple wardrobe know. 
there be sea green water silk with golden dragon. terra cotta cr√™pe with ivory white chrysanthemum cluster upon it. black bar silk shoot with yellow flame. lapis lazuli silk and silver fish. avanturine silk with plaque of grey green let in. cloth of gold over dragon s blood. and saffron and brown silk stiff a a board with embroidery. we return to the temple now fill with the gorgeous robe. the little lacquer stand be the priest book rack. some lay down among them while others move very softly about the golden altar and the incense burner. and the high priest dispose himself with his back to the congregation in a golden chair through which his robe wink like the shard of a tiger beetle. 
in solemn calm the book be unroll and the priest begin chant pali text in honour of the apostle of unworldliness who have write that they be not to wear gold or mix colour or touch the precious metal. but for a few unimportant accessory in the way of half see image of great men but these could have be call saint the scene before me might have be unroll in a roman catholic cathedral say the rich one at arundel. the same think be in other mind for in a pause of the slow chant a voice behind me whisper. 
to hear the bless mutter of the mass and see god make and eat all day long. 
it be a man from hong kong very angry that he too have not be permit to photograph an interior. he call all this splendour of ritual and paraphernalia just an interior and revenge himself by spit brown at it. 
the chant quicken a the service draw to an end and the candle burn low. 
we go away to other part of the temple pursue by the chorus of the devout till we be out of earshot in a paradise of screen. two or three hundred year ago there live a painterman of the name of kano. him the temple of chion in bring to beautify the wall of the room. since a wall be a screen and a screen be a wall kano r. a. have rather a large job. but he be help by pupil and imitator and in the end leave a few hundred screen which be all finish picture. a you already know the interior of a temple be very simple in it arrangement. the priest live on white mat in little room with brown ceiling that can at pleasure be throw into one large room. this also be the arrangement at chion in though the room be comparatively large and give on to sumptuous verandah and passage. since the emperor occasionally visit the place there be a room set apart for him of more than ordinary splendour. twist silk tassel of intricate design serve in lieu of catch to pull back the slide screen and the woodwork be lacquer. these be only feeble word but it be not in my grip to express the restfulness of it all or the power that know how to secure the desire effect with a turn of the wrist. the great kano draw numb pheasant huddle together on the snow cover bough of a pine. or a peacock in his pride spread his tail to delight his womenfolk. or a riot of chrysanthemum pour out of a vase. or the figure of toilworn countryfolk come home from market. or a hunt scene at the foot of fujiyama. the equally great carpenter who build the temple frame each picture with absolute precision under a ceiling that be a miracle of device and time the great artist of the three touch the gold so that it become amber and the woodwork so that it grow dark honey colour and the shin surface of the lacquer so that it become deep and rich and semi transparent. a in one room so in all the others. sometimes we slide back the screen and discover a tiny bald pat acolyte pray over an incense burner and sometimes a lean priest eat his rice. but generally the room be empty sweep and garnish. 
minor artist have work with kano the magnificent. these have be allow to lay brush upon panel of wood in the out verandah and very faithfully have they toil. it be not till the guide call my attention to them that i discover score of sketch in monochrome low down on the verandah door. an iris break by the fall of a branch tear off by a surly ape. a bamboo spray bow before the wind that be ruffle a lake. a warrior of the past ambush his enemy in a thicket hand on sword and mouth gather into pucker of intense concentration be among the many note that meet my eye. how long think you would a sepia draw stand without defacement in the midst of our civilisation be it put on the bottom panel of a door or the scantling of a kitchen passage. yet in this gentle country a man may stoop down and write his name in the very dust certain that if the write be craftily do his child s child will reverently let it stand. 
of course there be no such temple make nowadays i say when we regain the sunshine and the professor be try to find out how panel picture and paper screen go so well with the dark dignity of massive woodwork. 
they be build a temple on the other side of the city say mister yamagutchi. come along and see the hair rope which hang there. 
we come fly in our rickshaw across kioto till we saw net in a hundred cobweb of scaffold a temple even large than the great chion in. 
that be burn down long ago the old temple that be here you know. then the people make a penny subscription from all part of japan and those who could not send money send their hair to be make into rope. they have be ten year build this new temple. it be all wood say the guide. 
the place be alive with men who be put the finish touch to the great tile roof and lay down the floor. wooden pillar a gigantic carve a wantonly elaborate eaves a intricate in their moulding and joinery a perfect a anything in the chion in temple meet me at every turn. but the fresh cut wood be creamy white and lemon where in the old build it have be iron hard and brown. only the raw end of the joist be stop with white lacquer to prevent the incursion of insect and the deep tracery be protect against bird by fine wire net. everything else be wood wood down to the massive clamp and bolt beam of the foundation which i investigate through gap in the floor. 
japan be a great people. her mason play with stone her carpenter with wood her smith with iron and her artist with life death and all the eye can take in. mercifully she ha be deny the last touch of firmness in her character which would enable her to play with the whole round world. we posse that we the nation of the glass flower shade the pink worst mat the red and green china puppy dog and the poisonous brussels carpet. it be our compensation. 
temple. say a man from calcutta some hour late a i rave about what i have see. temple. i m sick of temple. if i ve see one i ve see fifty thousand of em all exactly alike. but i tell you what be excite. go down the rapid at arashima eight mile from here. it s good fun than any temple with a fat face buddha in the middle. 
but i take my friend s advice. have i manage to convey the impression that april be fine in japan. then i apologise. it be generally rainy and the rain be cold. but the sunshine when it come be worth it all. we shout with joy of live when our fiery untamed rickshaw bound from stone to stone of the vilely pave street of the suburb and bring u into what ought to have be vegetable garden but be call field. the face of the flat land be cut up in every direction by bunds and all the road seem to run on the top of them. 
never say the professor drive his stick into the black soil never have i imagine irrigation so perfectly control a this be. look at the rajbahars face with stone and fit with sluice. look at the water wheel and phew. but they manure their field too well. 
the first circle of field round any town be always pretty rank but this superfluity of scent continue throughout the country. save a few part near dacca and patna the face of the land be more thickly populate than bengal and be work five time good. there be no single patch untilled and no cultivation that be not up to the full limit of the soil s productiveness. onion barley in little ridge between the ridge of tea bean rice and a half a dozen other thing that we do not know the name of crowd the eye already weary with the glare of the golden mustard. manure be a good thing but manual labour be good. we saw both even to excess. when a japanese ryot ha do everything to his field that he can possibly think of he weed the barley stalk by stalk with his finger and thumb. this be true. i saw a man do it. 
we head through the marvellous country straight across the plain on which kioto stand till we reach the range of hill on the far side and find ourselves mix up with half a mile of lumber yard. 
cultivation and water cut be go and our tireless rickshaw be run by the side of a broad shallow river choke with log of every size. i be prepare to believe anything of the japanese but i do not see why nature which they say be the same pitiless power all the world over should send them their log unsplintered by rock neatly bark and with a slot neatly cut at the end of each pole for the reception of a rope i have see timber fly down the ravi in spate and it be hook out a rag a a tooth brush. this material come down clean. consequently the slot be another miracle. 
when the day be fine say the guide softly all the people of kioto come to arashima to have picnic. 
but they be always have picnic in the cherry tree garden. they picnic in the tea house. they they. 
yes when it be a fine day they always go somewhere and picnic. 
but why. man isn t make to picnic. 
but why. because it be a fine day. englishman say that the money of the japanese come from heaven because they always do nothing so you think. but look now here be a pretty place. 
the river charge down a turn in the pine grow hill and break in silver upon the timber and the remain of a light bridge wash away some day before. on our side and arrange so a to face the fair view of the young maple stand a row of tea house and booth build over the stream. the sunlight that could not soften the gloom of the pine dwell tenderly among the green of the maple and touch the reach below where the cherry blossom break in pink foam against the black roof house of a village across the water. 
there i stop. 
no. xvi. 
the party in the parlour who play game. a complete history of all modern japanese art. a survey of the past and a prophecy of the future arrange and compose in the kioto factory. 
oh brave new world that ha such creature in it how beautiful mankind be. 
how i get to the tea house i cannot tell. perhaps a pretty girl wave a bough of cherry blossom at me and i follow the invitation. i know that i sprawl upon the mat and watch the cloud scud across the hill and the log fly down the rapid and smelt the smell of the raw peel timber and listen to the grunt of the boatman a they wrestle with that and the rush of the river and be altogether happy than it be lawful for a man to be. 
the lady of the tea house insist upon screen u off from the other pleasure party who be tiffining in the same verandah. she bring beautiful blue screen with stork on them and slide them into groove. i stand it a long a i could. there be peal of laughter in the next compartment the patter of soft foot the clink of little dish and at the chink of the screen the twinkle of diamond eye. a whole family have come in from kioto for the day s pleasuring. mamma look after grandmamma and the young aunt look after a guitar and the two girl of fourteen and fifteen look after a merry little tomboy of eight who when she think of it look after the baby who have the air of look after the whole party. grandmamma be dress in dark blue mamma in blue and grey the girl have gorgeous dress of lilac fawn and primrose cr√™pe with silk sash the colour of apple blossom and the inside of a newly cut melon. the tomboy be in old gold and russet brown. but the baby tumble his fat little body across the floor among the dish in the colour of the japanese rainbow which own no crude tint. they be all pretty all except grandmamma who be merely good humour and very bald and when they have finish their dainty dinner and the brown lanquer stand the blue and white crockery and the jade green drink cup have be take away the aunt play a little piece on the samisen_ and the girl play blindman s buff all round the tiny room. 
flesh and blood could not have stay on the other side of the screen. i want to play too but i be too big and too rough and so could only sit in the verandah watch these dainty bit of dresden at their game. they shriek and giggle and chatter and sit down on the floor with the innocent abandon of maidenhood and break off to kiss the baby when he show sign of be overlook. they play pus in the corner their foot tie with blue and white handkerchief because the room do not allow unfettered freedom of limb and when they could play no more for laugh they fan themselves a they lay prop up against the blue screen each girl a picture no painter could reproduce and i shriek with the best of them till i roll off the verandah and nearly drop into the laugh street. be i a fool. then i fool in good company for an austere man from india a person who put his faith in race horse and belief nothing except the civil code be also at arashima that day. i meet him flush and excite. 
have a lively time he pant with a hundred child at his heel. there s a sort of roulette table here where you can gamble for cake. i buy the owner s stock in trade for three dollar and run the monte carlo for the benefit of the kid about five thousand of em. never have such fun in my life. it beat the simla lottery hollow. they be perfectly orderly till they have clear the table of everything except a big sugar tortoise. then they rush the bank and i run away. 
and he be a hard man who have not play with anything a innocent a sweetmeat for many year. 
when we be all weak with laugh and the professor s camera be mix up in a tangle of laugh maiden to the confusion of his picture we too run away from the tea house and wander down the river bank till we find a boat of sew plank which pole u across the swell river and land u on a little rocky path overhang the water where the iris and the violet run riot together and jubilant waterfall race through the undergrowth of pine and maple. we be at the foot of the arashima rapid and all the pretty girl of kioto be with u look at the view. up stream a lonely black pine stand out from all it fellow to peer up the bend where the race water run deep in oily swirl. down stream the river thresh across the rock and trouble the field of fresh log on it bosom while men in blue drive silver white boat gunwale deep into the foam of it onset and hook the log away. underfoot the rich earth of the hillside send up the breath of the turn of the year to the maple that have already catch the message from the fire wind of april. oh. it be good to be alive to trample the stalk of the iris to drag down the cherry bloom spray in a wash of dew across the face and to gather the violet for the mere pleasure of heave them into the torrent and reach out for fair flower. 
what a nuisance it be to be a slave to the camera say the professor upon whom the dumb influence of the season be work though he know it not. 
what a nuisance it be to be a slave to the pen i answer for the spring have come to the land. i have hat the spring for seven year because to me it mean discomfort. 
let u go straight home and see the flower come out in the park. 
let u enjoy what lie to our hand you philistine. and we do till a cloud darken and a wind ruffle the river reach and we return to our rickshaw sigh with contentment. 
how many people do you suppose the land support to the square mile. say the professor at a turn in the homeward road. he have be read statistic. 
nine hundred i say at a venture. it s thick set with human than sarun or behar. say one thousand. 
two thousand two hundred and fifty odd. can you believe it. 
look at the landscape i can but i don t suppose india will believe it. s pose i write fifteen hundred. 
they ll say you exaggerate just the same. good stick to the true total. two thousand two hundred and fifty six to the square mile and not a sign of poverty in the house. how do they do it. 
i should like to know the answer to that question. japan of my limit view be inhabit almost entirely by little child whose duty be to prevent their elder from become too frivolous. the baby do a little work occasionally but their parent interfere by pet them. at yami s hotel the attendance be in the hand of ten year old because everybody else ha go out picnic among the cherry tree. the little imp find time to do a man s work and to scuffle on the staircase between while. my special servitor call the bishop on account of the gravity of his appearance his blue apron and gaiter be the lively of the lot but even his energy cannot account for the professor s statistic of population. 
i have see one sort of work among the japanese but it be not the kind that make crop. it be purely artistic. a ward of the city of kioto be devote to manufacture. a manufacturer in this part of the world doe not hang out a sign. he may be know in paris and new york. that be the concern of the two city. the englishman who wish to find his establishment in kioto ha to hunt for him up and down slum with the aid of a guide. i have see three manufactory. the first be of porcelain ware the second of cloissonn√©e_ and the third of lacquer inlay and bronze. the first be behind black wooden paling and for external appearance might just a well have be a tripe shop. inside sit the manager opposite a tiny garden four foot square in which a papery look palm grow out of a coarse stoneware pot and overshadow a dwarf pine. the rest of the room be fill with pottery wait to be pack modern satsuma for the most part the sort of thing you get at an auction. 
this make send europe india america say the manager calmly. you come to see. 
he take u along a verandah of polish wood to the kiln to the clay vat and the yard where the tiny saggers be await their complement of pottery. there be difference many and technical between japanese and burslem pottery in the make but these be of no consequence. in the mould house where they be make the body of satsuma vas the wheel all work by hand run true a a hair. the potter sit on a clean mat with his tea thing at his side. when he have turn out a vase body he saw that it be good nod appreciatively to himself and pour out some tea ere start the next one. the potter live close to the kiln and have nothing pretty to look at. it be different in the paint room. here in a cabinet like house sit the men woman and boy who paint the design on the vas after the first fire. that all their arrangement be scrupulously neat be only say that they be japanese. that their surround be fair and proper be only say that they be artist. a sprig of a cherry blossom stand out defiantly against the black of the garden pal. a gnarl pine cut the blue of the sky with it spiky splinter a it lift itself above the pal and in a little pond the iris and the horsetail nod to the wind. the worker when at fault have only to lift their eye and nature herself would graciously supply the miss link of a design. somewhere in dirty england men dream of craftsman work under condition which shall help and not stifle the half form think. they even form guild and write semi rhythmical prayer to time and chance and all the other god that they worship to bring about the desire end. would they have their dream realise let them see how they make pottery in japan each man sit on a snowy mat with loveliness of line and colour within arm s length of him while with downcast eye he splash in the conventional diaper of a satsuma vase a fast a he can. the barbarian want satsuma and they shall have it if it ha to be make in kioto one piece per twenty minute. so much for the base form of the craft. 
the owner of the second establishment live in a blackwood cabinet it be profanation to call it a house alone with a bronze of priceless workmanship a set of blackwood furniture and all the medal that his work have win for him in england france germany and america. he be a very quiet and cat like man and speak almost in a whisper. would we be please to inspect the manufactory. he lead u through a garden it be nothing in his eye but we stop to admire long. stone lantern green with moss peep through clump of papery bamboo where bronze stork be pretend to fee. a dwarf pine it foliage trim to dish like plaque throw it arm far across a fairy pond where the fat lazy carp grub and root and a couple of eared grebe squawk at u from the protection of the waterbutt. so perfect be the silence of the place that we hear the cherry blossom fall into the water and the lisp of the fish against the stone. we be in the very heart of the willow pattern plate and loath to move for fear of break it. the japanese be bear bower bird. they collect water wear stone quaintly shape rock and vein pebble for the ornamentation of their home. when they shift house they take the garden away with them pine tree and all and the incoming tenant ha a free hand. 
half a dozen step take u over the path of mossy stone to a house where the whole manufactory be at work. one room hold the enamel powder all neatly arrange in jar of scrupulous cleanliness a few blank copper vas ready to be operate on an invisible bird who whistle and whoop in his cage and a case of gaily paint butterfly ready for reference when pattern be want. in the next room sit the manufactory three men five woman and two boy all a silent a sleep. it be one thing to read of cloissonn√©e make but quite another to watch it be make. i begin to understand the cost of the ware when i saw a man work out a pattern of sprig and butterfly on a plate about ten inch in diameter. with fine silver ribbon wire set on edge le than the sixteenth of an inch high he follow the curve of the draw at his side pinch the wire into tendril and the serrate outline of leaf with infinite patience. a rough touch on the raw copper plate would have send the pattern fly into a thousand disconnect thread. when all be put down on the copper the plate would be warm just sufficiently to allow the wire to stick firmly to the copper the pattern then show in raise line. follow the colour which be do by little boy in spectacle. with a pair of tiny steel chopstick they fill from bowl at their side each compartment of the pattern with it proper hue of paste. there be not much room allow for error in fill the spot on a butterfly s wing with avanturine enamel when the say wing be le than an inch across. i watch the delicate play of wrist and hand till i be weary and the manager show me his pattern terrible dragon cluster chrysanthemum butterfly and diaper a fine a frost on a window pane all draw in unerring line. those thing be our subject. i compile from them and when i want some new colour i go and look at those dead butterfly say he. after the enamel ha be fill in the pot or plate go to be fire and the enamel bubble all over the boundary line of wire and the whole come from the furnace look like delicate majolica. it may take a month to put a pattern on the plate in outline another month to fill in the enamel but the real expenditure of time doe not commence till the polish. a man sit down with the rough article all his tea thing a tub of water a flannel and two or three saucer full of assort pebble from the brook. he doe not get a wheel with tripoli or emery or buff. he sit down and rub. he rub for a month three month or a year. he rub lovingly with his soul in his finger end and little by little the efflorescence of the fire enamel give way and he come down to the line of silver and the pattern in all it glory be there wait for him. i saw a man who have only be a month over the polish of one little vase five inch high. he would go on for two month. when i be in america he will be rub still and the ruby colour dragon that romp on a field of lazuli each tiny scale and whisker a separate compartment of enamel will be grow more lovely. 
there be also cheap cloissonn√©e to be buy say the manager with a smile. we cannot make that. the vase will be seventy dollar. 
i respect him for say cannot instead of do not. there speak the artist. 
our last visit be pay to the large establishment in kioto where boy make gold inlay on iron sit in camphor wood verandah overlook a garden lovely than any that have go before. they have be catch young even a be the custom in india. a real grow up man be employ on the horrible story in iron gold and silver of two priest who wake up a rain dragon and have to run for it all round the edge of a big shield. but the lively worker of the batch be a small fat baby who have be give a tenpenny nail a hammer and a block of metal to play with that he might soak in the art by which he would live through the pore of his skin. he crow and chuckle a he whack. there be not many five year old in england who could hammer anything without pulp their little pink finger. the baby have learn how to hit straight. on the wall of the room hang a japanese paint of the apotheosis of art. it represent with fidelity all the process of pottery from the dig of the clay to the last fire. but all the pencil scorn of the artist be reserve for the close scene where an englishman his arm round his wife s waist be inspect a shop full of curio. the japanese be not impress with the grace of our clothe or the beauty of our countenance. late we behold the manufacture of gold lacquer which be lay on speck by speck from an agate palette fit on the artist s thumb. and the carve of ivory which be excite until you begin to realise that the grave never slip. 
a lot of their art be purely mechanical say the professor when he be safe back in the hotel. 
so s a lot of ours specially our picture. only we can t be spiritedly mechanical i answer. fancy a people like the japanese solemnly go in for a constitution. observe. the only two nation with constitution worth have be the english and the american. the english can only be artistic in spot and by way of the art of other nation sicilian tapestry persian saddle bag khoten carpet and the sweeping of pawn broker shop. the american be artistic so long a a few of em can buy their art to keep abreast of the time with. spain be artistic but she be also disturb at interval. france be artistic but she must have her revolution every twenty year for the sake of fresh material. russia be artistic but she occasionally wish to kill her czar and ha no sort of government. germany be not artistic because she experience religion. and italy be artistic because she do very badly. india. 
when you have finish your verdict on the world perhaps you ll go to bed. 
consequently i continue with scorn i be of opinion that a constitution be the bad thing in the world for a people who be bless with soul above the average. now the first demand of the artistic temperament be mundane uncertainty. the second be. 
sleep say the professor and leave the room. 
no. xvii. 
of the nature of the tokaido and japanese railway construction. one traveller explain the life of the sahib log and another the origin of dice. of the baby in the bath tub and the man in d. t. 
when i go to hell i speak to the man on the road. 
old saw. 
you know the story of the miner who borrow a dictionary and return it with the remark that the story though interest in the main be too various. i have the same complaint to make against japanese scenery twelve hour of it by train from nagoya to yokohama. about seven hundred year ago the king of those day build a sea road which he call the tokaido. or else all the sea coast be call the tokaido but it s of no importance. which road endure to the present. late on when the english engineer appear he follow the grand trunk more or le closely and the result ha be a railway that any nation might take off their hat to. the last section of the through line from kioto to yokohama be only open five day before the professor and i honour it with an unofficial inspection. 
the accommodation of all kind be arrange for the benefit of the japanese. and this be distress to the foreigner who expect in a carriage remotely resemble e. i. r. roll stock the convenience of that pea green and very dusty old line. but it suit the japanese admirably. they hop out at every other station pro re nata and occasionally get leave behind. two day ago they manage to kill a government official of high stand between a footboard and a platform and to day the japanese paper be seriously discuss the advantage of lavatory. far be it from me to interfere with the arrangement of an artistic empire. but for a twelve hour run there might at least be arrangement. 
we have leave the close pack cultivation at the foot of the hill and be run along the shore of a great lake all steel blue from one end to the other except where it be dot with little island. then the lake turn into an arm of the sea and we run across it on a cut stone causeway and the profligacy of the pine cease a the tree have to come down from clothe dank hill and fight with bow head outstretched arm and firmly plant foot against the sand of the pacific whose breaker be spout and blow not a quarter of a mile away from the causeway. the jap know all about forestry. they stake down wander sand torrent which be still allow to ruin our crop in the hoshiarpur district and they plug a shift sand dune with wattle dam and pine seedling a cleverly a they would pin plank to plank. be their forest officer train at nancy or be they local product. the stake bind use to hold the sand be of french pattern and the diagonal plant out of the tree be also french. 
half a minute after the train drop this desolate hardly control beach it race through four or five mile of the suburb of patna but a clean and glorify patna bower in bamboo plantation. then it hit a tunnel and sail forth into a section of the london brighton and south coast or whatever the line be that want to make the channel tunnel. at any rate the embankment be on the beach and the wave lap the foot of it and there be a wall of cut rock to landward. then we disturb many village of fisherman whose verandah give on to the track and whose net lay almost under our wheel. the railway be still a new thing in that particular part of the world for mother hold up their babe to see it. 
any one can keep pace with indian scenery arrange a it be in reach of five hundred mile. this blind alternation of field mountain sea beach forest bamboo grove and roll moor cover with azalea blossom be too much for me so i seek the society of a man who have live in japan for twenty year. 
yes japan s an excellent country a regard climate. the rain begin in may or latter april. june july and august be hot month. i ve know the thermometer a high a ¬∞ at night but i d defy the world to produce anything more perfect than the weather between september and may. when one get seedy one go to the hot spring in the hakone mountain close to yokohama. there be heap of place to recruit in but we english be a healthy lot. of course we don t have half a much fun a you do in india. we be a small community and all our amusement be organise by ourselves for our own benefit concert race and amateur theatrical and the like. you have heap of em in india haven t you. 
oh yes. i say we enjoy ourselves awfully specially about this time of the year. i quite understand though that small community dependent on themselves for enjoyment be apt to feel a little slow and isolate almost bore in fact. but you be say. 
well live be not very dear and house rent be. a hundred dollar a month get you a decent house and you can get one for sixty. but house property be down just now in yokohama. the race be on in yokohama to day and monday. be you go. no. you ought to go and see all the foreigner enjoy themselves. but i suppose you ve see much good thing in india haven t you. you haven t anything good than old fuji fujiyama. there he be now to the leave of the line. what do you think of him. 
i turn and behold fujiyama across a sea of upward slop field and wood. it be about fourteen thousand foot high not very much accord to our idea. but fourteen thousand foot above the sea when one stand in the midst of sixteen thousand foot peak be quite another thing from the same height note at sea level in a comparatively flat country. the labour eye crawl up every foot of the dead crater s smooth flank and at the summit confess that it ha see nothing in all the himalaya to match the monster. i be satisfy. fujiyama be exactly a i have see it on fan and lacquer box. i would not have sell my sight of it for the crest of kinchinjunga flush with the morning. fujiyama be the keynote of japan. when you understand the one you be in a position to learn something about the other. i try to get information from my fellow traveller. 
yes the japanese be build railway all over the island. what i mean to say be that the company be start and finance by jap and they make em pay. i can t quite tell you where the money come from but it s all to be find in the country. japan s neither rich nor poor but just comfortable. i m a merchant myself. can t say that i altogether like the jap way o do business. you can never be certain whether the little beggar mean what he say. give me a chinaman to deal with. other men have tell you that have they. you ll find that opinion at most of the treaty port. but what i will say be that the japanese government be about a enterprising a government a you could wish and a good one to have dealing with. when japan ha finish reconstruct herself on the new line she ll be quite a respectable little power. see if she isn t. now we be come into the hakone mountain. watch the railway. it s rather a curiosity. 
we come into the hakone mountain by way of some irish scenery a scotch trout stream a devonshire combe and an indian river run masterless over half a mile of pebble. this be only the prelude to a set of geological illustration include the terrace form by ancient river bed denudation and half a dozen other ations. i be so busy tell the man from yokohama lie about the height of the himalaya that i do not watch thing closely till we get to yokohama at eight in the even and go to the grand hotel where all the clean and nicely dress people who be just go in to dinner regard u with scorn and men whom we have meet on steamer aforetime dive into photograph book and pretend not to see u. there s a deal of human nature in a man get up for dinner when a woman be watch him and you look like a brick layer even in yokohama. 
the grand be the semi or cottage grand really but you have good go there unless a friend tell you of a good. a long course of good luck ha spoil me for even average hotel. they be too fine and large at the grand and they don t always live up to their grandeur. unlimited electric bell but no one in particular to answer em. print menu but the first comer eat all the nice thing and so forth. none the le there be point about the grand not to be despise. it be model on the american fashion and be but an open door through which you may catch the first gust from the pacific slope. officially there be twice a many english a american in the port. actually you hear no language but french german or american in the street. my experience be sadly limit but the american i have hear up to the present be a tongue a distinct from english a patagonian. 
a gentleman from boston be kind enough to tell me something about it. he defend the use of i guess a a shakespearian expression to be find in richard the third. i have learn enough never to argue with a bostonian. 
all right i say i ve never hear a real american say i guess. but what about the balance of your extraordinary tongue. do you mean to say that it ha anything in common with ours except the auxiliary verb the name of the creator and damn. listen to the men at the next table. 
they be westerner say the man from boston a who should say observe this cassowary. they be westerner and if you want to make a western mad tell him he be not like an englishman. they think they be like the english. they be awfully thin skin in the west. now in boston it s different. we don t care what the english people think of u. 
the idea of the english people sit down to think about boston while boston on the other side of the water ostentatiously didn t care make me snigger. the man tell me story. he belong to a republic. that be why every man of his acquaintance belong either to one of the first family in boston or else be of good salem stock and his father have come over in the mayflower. i felt a though i be move in the midst of a novel. fancy have to explain to the casual strange the blood and breed of the hero of every anecdote. i wonder whether many people in boston be like my friend with the salem family. i be go there to see. 
there s no romance in america it s all hard business fact say a man from the pacific slope after i have express my opinion about some rather curious murder case which might have be call miscarriage of justice. ten minute late i hear him say slowly apropos of a game call round the horn. this be a bad game. don t play it with a strange. well it s a good thing for this game that omaha come up. dice be invent in omaha and the man who invent em he make a colossal fortune. 
i say nothing. i begin to feel faint. the man must have notice it. six and twenty year ago omaha come up he repeat look me in the eye and the number of dice that have be make in omaha since that time be incalculable. 
there be no romance in america i moan like a stricken ring dive in the professor s ear. nothing but hard business fact and the first family of boston massachusetts invent dice at omaha when it first come up twenty six year ago and that s the solid truth. what be i to do with a people like this. 
be you describe japan or america. for goodness sake stick to one or the other say the professor. 
it wasn t my fault. there s a bite of america in the bar room and on my word it s rather more interest than japan. let s go across to frisco and hear some more lie. 
let s go and look at photograph and refrain from mix our country or our drink. 
by the way wherever you go in the further east be humble to the white trader. recollect that you be only a poor beast of a buyer with a few dirty dollar in your pocket and you can t expect a man to demean himself by take them. and observe humility not only in the shop but elsewhere. i be anxious to know how i should cross the pacific to frisco and very foolishly go to an office where they might under certain circumstance be suppose to attend to these thing. but no anxiety trouble the sprightly soul who happen to be in the office chair. there s heap of time for find out late on he say and anyhow i m go to the race this afternoon. come late on. i put my head in the spittoon and crawl out under the door. 
when i be leave behind by the steamer it will console me to know that that young man have a good time and win heavily. everybody keep horse in yokohama and the horse be nice little fat little tub of the circus persuasion. i didn t go to the race but a calcutta man do and return say that they run cart horse and even time for a mile be four minute and twenty seven second. perhaps he have lose heavily but i can vouch for the rid of the few gentleman i saw outside the animal. it be very impartial and remarkably all round. 
just when the man from boston be begin to tell me some more story about first family the professor develop an unholy taste for hot spring and bore me off to a place call myanoshita to wash myself. we ll come back and look at yokohama late on but we must go to this because it s so beautiful. 
i m get tire of scenery. it s all beautiful and it can t be describe but these men here tell you story about america. do you ever hear how the people of carmel lynch edward m. petree for preach the gospel without make a collection at the end of the service. there s no romance in america it s all hard business fact. edward m. petree be. 
_are you go to see japan or be you not. 
i go to see. first in a train for one hour in the company of a carriageful of howl globe trotter then in a rickshaw for four. you cannot appreciate scenery unless you sit in a rickshaw. we strike after seven mile of modify flat the flattery of nature that lure you to her more rugged heart a mountain river all black pool and boil foam. him we follow into the hill along a road cut into the crumble volcanic rock and entirely unmetalled. it be a hard a the simla cartroad but those far hill behind kalka have no such pine and maple ash and willow. it be a land of green clothe cliff and silver waterfall lovely beyond the defilement of the pen. at every turn in the road whence a view could be command stand a little tea house full of admire japanese. the jap dress in blue because he know that it contrast well with the colour of the pine. when he dy he go to a heaven of his own because the colour of ours be too crude to suit him. 
we keep the valley of the glorify stream till the water sink out of sight down the cliff side and we could but hear them call to one another through the tangle of the tree. where the woodland be lovely the gorge deep and the colour of the young hornbeam most tender they have clap down two vile hostelry of wood and glass and a village that live by sell turn wood and glass inlay thing to the tourist. 
australian anglo indian dweller in london and the part beyond the channel be run up and down the slope of the hotel garden and by their strange dress do all they know to deface the landscape. the professor and i slide down the cliff at the back and find ourselves back in japan once more. rough step take u five or six hundred foot down through dense jungle to the bed of that stream we have follow all the day. the air vibrate with the rush of a hundred torrent and whenever the eye could pierce the undergrowth it saw a headlong stream break itself on a boulder. up at the hotel we have leave the gray chill of a november day and cold that numb the finger. down in the gorge we find the climate of bengal with real steam throw in. green bamboo pipe lead the hot water to a score of bath house in whose verandah japanese in blue and white dress gown lounge and smoke. from unseen thicket come the shout of those who bath and oh shame. round the corner stroll a venerable old lady chastely rob in a white bath towel and not too much of that. then we go up the gorge mop our brow and star to the sky through arch of rampant foliage. 
japanese maid of fourteen or fifteen be not altogether displease to behold. i have not see more than twenty or thirty of them. of these none be in the least disconcert at the sight of the strange. after all twas but brighton beach without the bath gown. at the head of the gorge the heat become great and the hot water more abundant. the joint of the water pipe on the grind give off jet of steam. there be vapour rise from boulder on the river bed and the stab of a stick into the warm moist soil be follow by a little pool of warm water. the exist supply be not enough for the inhabitant. they be mine for more in a casual and disconnect fashion. i try to crawl down a shaft eighteen inch by two foot in the hillside but the steam which have no effect on the japanese hide drive me out. what happen i wonder when the pick strike the liquid and the miner ha to run or be parboil. 
in the twilight when we have reach upper earth once more and be pass through the one street of myanoshita we saw two small fat cherub about three year old take their even tub in a barrel sink under the eaves of a shop. they feign great fear peep at u behind outspread finger attempt futile dive and try to hide one behind the other in a hundred pose of spankable chubbiness while their father urge them to splash u. it be the pretty picture of the day and one worth come even to the sticky paint reek hotel to see. 
* * * * *. 
he be dress in a black frock coat and at first i take him for a missionary a he moon up and down the empty corridor. 
i have be under a ban for three day he whisper in a husky voice through no fault of mine no fault of mine. they tell me to take the third watch but they didn t give me a print notification which i always require and the manager of this place say that whisky would hurt me. through no fault of mine god know no fault of mine. 
i do not like be shut up in an echo wooden hotel next door to a gentleman of the marine persuasion who be just recover from d. t. and who talk to himself all through the dark hour. 
no. xviii. 
concern a hot water tap and some general conversation. 
always speak to the strange. if he doesn t shoot the chance be he ll answer you. western proverb. 
it be a far cry from myanoshita to michni and mandalay. that be why we have meet men from both those station and have spend a cheerful time talk about dacoit and the black mountain expedition. one of the advantage of foreign travel be that one take such a keen interest in and hear so much about home. truly they change their train but not their train of think who run across the sea. 
this be a most extraordinary place say the professor red a a boil lobster. you sit in your bath and turn on the hot or cold spring a you choose and the temperature be phenomenal. let s go and see where it all come from and then let s go away. 
there be a place call the burn mountain five mile in the hill. there go we through unbroken loveliness of bamboo copse pine wood grass down and pine wood again while the river growl below. in the end we find an impoverish and second hand hell set out orderly on the side of a raw and bleed hillside. it look a though a match factory have be whelm by a landslip. water in which bad egg have be boil stand in blister lipped pool and puff of thin white smoke go up from the labour under earth. despite the smell and the sulphur incrustation on the black rock i be disappoint till i felt the heat of the grind which be the heat of a boiler sheathe. they call the mountain extinct. if untold ton of power case in a few foot of dirt be the japanese notion of extinction glad i be that i have not be introduce to a lively volcano. indeed it be not an overweening notion of my own importance but a tender regard for the fire crust below and a dread of start the machinery by accident that make me step so delicately and urge return upon the professor. 
huh. it s only the boiler of your morning bath. all the source of the spring be here say he. 
i don t care. let em alone. do you never hear of a boiler burst. don t prod about with your stick in that amateur way. you ll turn on the tap. 
when you have see a burn mountain you begin to appreciate japanese architecture. it be not solid. every one be burn out once or twice casually. a business isn t respectable until it ha receive it baptism of fire. but fire be of no importance. the one thing that inconvenience a jap be an earthquake. consequently he arrange his house that it shall fall lightly a a bundle of broom upon his head. still further safeguard himself he ha no foundation but the corner post rest on the crown of round stone sink in the earth. the corner post take the wave of the shock and though the build may give way like an eel trap nothing very serious happen. this be what epicure of earthquake aver. i wait for mine own experience but not near a suspect district such a the burn mountain. 
it be only to escape from one terror to another that i flee myanoshita. a blue breeched dwarf thrust me into a dwarf rickshaw on spidery wheel and down the rough road that we have take four hour to climb run me clamorously in half an hour. take all the parapet off the simla road and leave it alone for ten year. then run down the steep four mile of any section not steep than the drop to the old gaiety theatre behind one man. 
we couldn t get six hill men to take u in this style shout the professor a he spin by his wheel kick like a duck s foot and the whole contraption at an angle of thirty. i be proud to think that not even sixty hill men would have gambol with a sahib in that disgraceful manner. nor would any tramway company in the real east have run it car to catch a train that use to start last year but now rest it soul be a dead a queen anne. this thing a queer little seven mile tramway accomplish with much dignity. it own a first class car and a second class car two horse to each and it run them with a hundred yard headway the one all but empty and the other half full. when the very small driver could not control his horse which happen on the average once every two minute he do not waste time by pull them in. he screw down the brake and laugh possibly at the company who have pay for the very elaborate car. yet he be an artistic driver. he wear no philistine brass badge. between the shoulder of his blue jerkin be do in white three railhead in a circle and on the skirt a many tram wheel conventionalise. only the japanese know how to conventionalise a tram wheel or make a key pattern of railhead. though we take twelve hour to cover the thirty mile that separate u from yokohama we admit this much while we wait for our train in a village by the sea. a village of any size be about three mile long in the main street. village with a population of more than ten thousand soul take rank a town. 
and yet say a man at yokohama that night you have not see the dense population. that s away in the western ken district a you call them. the folk really be crowd thereabouts but virtually poverty doe not exist in the country. you see an agricultural labourer can maintain himself and his family a far a rice go for four cent a day and the price of fish be nominal. rice now cost a hundred pound to the dollar. what do you make it by indian standard. from twenty to twenty five seer the rupee. yes that s about it. well he get perhaps three dollar and a half a month. the people spend a good deal in pleasuring. they must enjoy themselves. i don t think they save much. how do they invest their saving. in jewellery. no not exactly. though you ll find that the woman s hair pin which be about the only jewellery they wear cost a good deal. seven and eight dollar be pay for a good hair pin and of course jade may cost anything. what the woman really lock their money up in be in their obi the thing you call sash. an obi be ten or twelve yard long and i ve know them sell wholesale for fifty dollar each. every woman above the poor class ha at least one good dress of silk and an obi. yes all their saving go in dress and a handsome dress be always worth have. the western ken be the rich take all round. a skilled mechanic there get a dollar or dollar and a half a day and a you know lacquer worker and inlayers artist get two. there s enough money in japan for all current expense. they win t borrow any for railroad. they raise it emselves. most progressive people the japanese be a regard railway. they make them very cheaply much more cheaply than any european line. i ve some experience and i take it that two thousand pound a mile be the average cost of construction. not on the tokaido of course the line that you come up by. that s a government line state build and a very expensive one. i m speak of the japanese railway company with a mileage of three hundred and the line from kob√© south and the kinshin line in the southern island. there be lot of little company with a few score mile of line but all the company be extend. the reason why the construction be so cheap be the nature of the land. there s no long haulage of rail because you can nearly always find a creek run far up into the country and dump out your rail within a few mile of the place where they be want. then again all your timber lie to your hand and your staff be jap. there be a few european engineer but they be quite the head of the department and i believe if they be clear out to morrow the jap would go on build their line. they know how to make em pay. one line start on a state guarantee of eight per cent. it hasn t call for the guarantee yet. it s make twelve per cent on it own hook. there s a very heavy freight traffic in wood and provision for the big town and there s a local traffic that you can have no idea of unless you ve watch it. the people seem to move in twenty mile circle for business or pleasure specially pleasure. oh i tell you japan will be a gridiron of railway before long. in another month or two you ll be able to travel nearly seven hundred mile on and by the tokaido line alone from one end to the other of the central island. get from east to west be hard work. the backbone hill of the country be just cruel and it will be some time before the jap run many line across. but they ll do it of course. their country must go forward. 
if you want to know anything about their politics i m afraid i can t help you much. they be so to speak drink with western liquor and be suck it up by the hogshead. in a few year they will see how much of what we call civilisation they really want and how much they can discard. tisn t a if they have to learn the art of life or how to make themselves comfortable. they know all that long ago. when their railway system be complete and they begin to understand their new constitution they will have learn a much a we can teach em. that s my opinion. but it need time to understand this country. i ve be a matter of eight or ten year in it and my view aren t worth much. i ve come to know some of the old family that use to be of the feudal nobility. they keep themselves to themselves and live very quietly. i don t think you ll find many of them in the official class. their one fault be that they entertain far beyond their mean. they win t receive you informally and take you into their house. they raise dance girl or take you to their club and have a big fee. they don t introduce you to their wife and they haven t yet give up the rule of make the wife eat after the husband. like the native of india you say. well i be very fond of the jap. but i suppose he be a native any way you look at him. you wouldn t think that he be careless in his workmanship and dishonest. a chinaman on an average be out and away a big rogue than a jap. but he ha sense enough to see that honesty be the best policy and to act by that light. a jap will be dishonest just to save himself trouble. he s like a child that way. 
how many time have i have to record such an opinion a the forego. everywhere the foreigner say the same thing of the neat hand polite little people that live among flower and baby and smoke tobacco a mild a their own manner. i be sorry. but when you come to think of it a race without a flaw would be perfect. and then all the other nation of the earth would rise up and hammer it to piece. and then there would be no japan. 
i ll give you a day to think over thing generally say the professor. after that we ll go to nikko and tokio. who ha not see nikko doe not know how to pronounce the world beautiful. 
yokohama be not the proper place to arrange impression in. the pacific ocean knock at your door ask to be look at. the japanese and american men of war demand serious attention through a telescope. and if you wander about the corridor of the grand hotel you stop to play with spanish general all gold lace and spur or be capture by tout for curio shop. it be not a nice experience to find a sahib in a panama hat hand you the card of his firm for all the world like a delhi silk merchant. you be incline to pity that man until he sit down give you a cigar and tell you all about his disease his past career in california where he be always make money and always lose it and his hope for the future. you see then that you be enter upon a new world. talk to every one you meet if they show the least disposition to talk to you and you will gather a i have do a host of story that will be of use to you hereafter. unfortunately they be not all fit for publication. when i tear myself away from the distraction of the out world and be just sit down to write seriously on the future of japan there enter a fascinate man with heap of money who have collect indian and japanese curio all his life and be now come to this country to get some old book which his collection lack. can you imagine a more pleasant life than his wandering over the earth with untold special knowledge to back each signature of his cheque book. 
in five minute he have carry me far away from the clatter fidgetty folk around to a quiet world where men meditate for three week over a bronze and scour all japan for a sword guard design by a great artist and be horribly cheat in the end. 
who be the best artist in japan now. i ask. 
he die in tokio last friday poor fellow and there be no one to take his place. his name be k and a a general rule he could never be persuade to work unless he be drink. he do his best picture when he be drink. 
_√©mu. artist be never drink. 
quite right. i ll show you a sword guard that he design. all the best artist out here do a lot of design. k use to fritter away his time on design for old friend. have he stick to picture he could have make twice a much. but he never turn out potboiler. when you go to tokio make it your business to get two little book of his call drunken sketch picture that he do when he be √©mu. there be enough dash and go in them to fill half a dozen studio. an english artist study under him for some time. but k s touch be not communicable though he might have teach his pupil something about technique. have you ever come across one of k s crow. you could tell it anywhere. he could put all the wicked thought that ever come into the mind of a crow and a crow be first cousin to the devil on a piece of paper six inch square with a brush of indian ink and two turn of his wrist. look at the sword guard i speak of. how be that for feel. 
on a circular piece of iron four inch in diameter and pierce by the pole for the tang of the blade poor k who die last friday have sketch the figure of a coolie try to fold up a cloth which be belly to a merry breeze not a cold wind but a sportive summer gust. the coolie be enjoy the performance and so be the cloth. it would all be fold up in another minute and the coolie would go on his way with a grin. 
this thing have k conceive and the faithful workman execute with the light touch of the grave to the end that it might lie in a collector s cabinet in london. 
wah. wah. i say and return it reverently. it would kill a man who could do that to live after his touch have go. well for him he die but i wish i have see him. show me some more. 
i ve get a paint by hokusai the great artist who live at the end of the last century and the begin of this. even you have hear of hokusai haven t you. 
a little. i have hear it be impossible to get a genuine paint with his signature attach. 
that s true. but i ve show this one to the japanese government expert in picture the man the mikado consult in case of doubt to the first european authority on japanese art and of course i have my own opinion to back the sign guarantee of the seller. look. 
he unroll a silk scroll and show me the figure of a girl in pale blue and grey cr√™pe carry in her arm a bundle of clothe that a the tub behind her show have just be wash. a dark blue handkerchief be throw lightly over the leave forearm shoulder and neck ready to tie up the clothe when the bundle should be put down. the flesh of the right arm show through the thin drapery of the sleeve. the right hand merely steady the bundle from above. the leave grip it firmly from below. through the stiff blue black hair show the outline of the leave ear. 
that there be enormous elaboration in the picture from the ornamentation of the hair pin to the grain of the clog do not strike me till after the first five minute when i have sufficiently admire the certainty of touch. 
recollect there be no room for error in paint on silk say the proud possessor. the line must stand under any circumstance. all that be possible before paint be a little dot with charcoal which be rub off with a feather brush. do he know anything about drapery or colour or the shape of a woman. be there any one who could teach him more if he be alive to day. 
then we go to nikko. 
no. xix. 
the legend of nikko ford and the story of the avoidance of misfortune. 
a rise red city half a old a time. 
five hour in the train take u to the begin of a rickshaw journey of twenty five mile. the guide unearth an age cart on japanese line and seduce u into it by promise of speed and comfort beyond anything that a rickshaw could offer. never go to nikko in a cart. the town of departure be full of pack pony who be not use to it and every third animal try to get a kick at his friend in the shaft. this render progress sufficiently excite till the bumpsomeness of the road quench all emotion save one. nikko be reach through one avenue of cryptomeria cypress like tree eighty foot high with red or dull silver trunk and hearse plume foliage of dark green. when i say one avenue i mean one continuous avenue twenty five mile long the tree so close to each other throughout that their root interlace and form a wall of wood on either side of the sink road. where it be necessary to make a village along the line of march that be to say once every two or three mile a few of the giant have be wrench out a teeth be wrench from a full plant jaw to make room for the house. then the tree close up a before to mount guard over the road. the bank between which we drive be alight with azalea camelia and violet. glorious. stupendous. magnificent. sing the professor and i in chorus for the first five mile in the interval of the bump. the avenue take not the least notice of our praise except by grow the tree even more closely together. vista of pillared shade be very pleasant to read about but on a cold day the ungrateful heart of man could cheerfully dispense with a mile or two of it if that would shorten the journey. we be blind to the beauty around. to the file of pack pony with mane like hearth broom and the temper of eblis kick about the path. to the pilgrim with blue and white handkerchief on their head enviable silver grey legging on their foot and buddha like baby on their back. to the trim country dray pull by miniature cart horse bring down copper from the mine and saki from the hill. to the colour and movement in the village where all the little child shout ohio s. and all the old people laugh. the grey tree trunk march u solemnly along over that horrid bad road which have be mend with brushwood and after five hour we get nikko in the shape of a long village at the foot of a hill and capricious nature to reward u for our sore bone laugh on the instant in flood of sunshine. and upon what a mad scene do the light fall. the cryptomeria rise in front of u a wall of green darkness a tear torrent run deep green over blue boulder and between stream and tree be throw a blood red bridge the sacred bridge of red lacquer that no foot save the mikado s may press. 
very cunning artist be the japanese. long ago a great hearted king come to nikko river and look across at the tree up stream at the torrent and the hill whence it come and down stream at the soft outline of the crop and spur of wooded mountain. it need only a dash of colour in the foreground to bring this all together say he and he put a little child in a blue and white dress gown under the awful tree to judge the effect. embolden by his tenderness an age beggar venture to ask for alms. now it be the ancient privilege of the great to try the temper of their blade upon beggar and such cattle. mechanically the king sweep off the old man s head for he do not wish to be disturb. the blood spurt across the granite slab of the river ford in a sheet of pure vermilion. the king smile. chance have solve the problem for him. build a bridge here he say to the court carpenter of just such a colour a that stuff on the stone. build also a bridge of grey stone close by for i would not forget the want of my people. so he give the little child across the stream a thousand piece of gold and go his way. he have compose a landscape. a for the blood they wipe it up and say no more about it. and that be the story of nikko bridge. you will not find it in the guide book. 
i follow the voice of the river through a rickety toy village across some rough bottom land till cross a bridge i find myself among lichened stone scrub and the blossom of spring. a hillside steep and wooded a the flank of the red aravallis rise on my leave. on my right the eye travel from village to cropland crop to tower cypress and rest at last on the cold blue of an austere hill top encircle by streak of yet unmelted snow. the nikko hotel stand at the foot of this hill. and the time of the year be may. then a sparrow come by with a piece of grass in her beak for she be build her nest. and i know that the spring be come to nikko. one be so apt to forget the change of the year over there with you in india. 
sit in a solemn line on the bank of the river be fifty or sixty cross legged image which the untrained eye put down immediately a so many small buddha. they have all even when the lichen have cloak them with leprosy the calm port and unwinking regard of the lord of the world. they be not buddha really but other thing present from forget great men to dead and go institution or else memorial of ancestor. the guide book will tell you. they be a ghostly crew. a i examine them more closely i saw that each differ from the other. many of them hold in their join arm a little store of river pebble evidently put there by the pious. when i inquire the mean of the gift from a strange who pass he say. those so distinguish be image of the god who play with little child up in the sky. he tell them story and build them house of pebble. the stone be put in his arm either that he may not forget to amuse the baby or to prevent his stock run low. 
i have no mean of tell whether the strange speak the truth but i prefer to believe that tale a gospel truth. only the japanese could invent the god who play with little child. thereafter the image take a new aspect in my eye and be no long gr√¶co buddhist sculpture but personal friend. i add a great heap of pebble to the stock of the cheery among them. his bosom be ornament with small print slip of prayer which give him the appearance of a disreputable old parson with his band in disorder. a little further up the bank of the river be a rough solitary rock hew with what men call a shinto shrine. i know good. the thing be hindu and i look at the smooth stone on every side for the familiar dab of red paint. on a flat rock overhang the water be carve certain character in sanscrit remotely resemble those on a thibetan prayer wheel. not comprehend these matter and grateful that i have bring no guide book with me i clamber down to the lip of the river now compress into a rag torrent. do you know the strid near bolton that spot where the full force of the river be pen up in two yard breadth. the nikko strid be an improvement upon the yorkshire one. the blue rock be hollow like soapstone by the rush of the water. they rise above head level and in spring be tufted with azalea blossom. the strange of the godlings come up behind me a i bask on a boulder. he point up the little gorge of rock now if i paint that a it stand every critic in the paper would say i be a liar. 
the mad stream come down directly from a blue hill blotch with pink through a sky blue gorge also pink blotch. an obviously impossible pine mount guard over the water. i would give much to see an accurate representation of that view. the strange depart growl over some hide grief connect with the academy perhaps. 
hound on by the professor the guide seek me by bank of the river and bid me come and see temple. then i fairly and squarely curse all temple be stretch at my ease on some warm sand in the hollow of a rock and ignorant a the grass shoe cattle that tramp the further bank. very fine temple say the guide you come and see. by and by temple be shut up because priest make half an hour more time. nikko time be half an hour ahead of the standard because the priest of the temple have discover that traveller arrive at three p. m. try to do all the temple before four the official hour of close. this defraud the church of her due so her servant put the clock on and nikko know naught of the value of time be well content. 
when i curse the temple i do a foolish thing and one for which this poor pen can never make fit reparation. we go up a hill by way of a flight of grey stone slab. the cryptomeria of the nikko road be a child to the giant that overshadow u here. between their iron grey bole be flash of red the blood red of the mikado s bridge. that great king who kill the beggar at the ford have be well please with the success of his experiment. pass under a mighty stone arch we come into a square of splendour alive with the sound of hammer. thirty or forty men be tap the pillar and step of a carnelian shrine heavy with gold. that say the guide impassively be a godown. they be renew the lacquer. first they extract it. 
have you ever extract lacquer from wood. i smite the foot of a pillar with force and after half a dozen blow chip off one small fragment of the stuff in texture like red horn. betray no surprise i demand the name of a yet more magnificent shrine across the courtyard. it be red lacquer like the others but above it main door be carve in open work three ape one with his hand to his ear another cover his mouth and a third blind his eye. 
that place say the guide use to be a stable when the daimio keep his horse there. the monkey be the three who hear no wrong say no wrong and see no wrong. 
of course i say. what a splendid device for a stable where the groom steal the grain. i be angry because i have grovel before a godown and a stable though the round world cannot hold their equal. 
we enter a temple or a tomb i do not know which through a gateway of carven pillar. eleven of them bore a run pattern of trefoil the apex point earthward the twelfth have it pattern reverse. 
make em all the same no good say the guide emphatically. something sure to come bad by an by. make one different all right. save him so. nothing happen then. 
unless i be mistake that voluntarily break of the set be the one sacrifice that the designer have make to the great god above who be so jealous of the craft of men. for the rest he have do what he please even a a god might have do with the wood in it gleam lacquer sheath with enamel and inlay and carve and bronze hammer work and the work of the inspire chisel. when he go to his account he save himself from the jealousy of his judge by point to the trefoil pillar for proof that he be only a weak mortal and in no sense their equal. men say that never man ha give complete drawing detail or description of the temple of nikko. only a german would try and he would fail in spirit. only a frenchman could succeed in spirit but he would be inaccurate. i have a recollection of pass through a door with cloisonn√©e hinge with a golden lintel and red lacquer jamb with panel of tortoise shell lacquer and clamp of bronze tracery. it open into a half light hall on whose blue ceiling a hundred golden dragon romp and spat fire. a priest move about the gloom with noiseless foot and show me a pot belly lantern four foot high that the dutch trader of old time have send a a present to the temple. there be post of red lacquer dust over with gold to support the roof. on one post lay a rib of lacquer six inch thick that have be carve or punch over with high relief carving and have set hard than crystal. 
the temple step be of black lacquer and the frame of the slide screen red. that money lakh and lakh of money have be lavish on the wonder impress me but little. i wish to know who be the men that when the cryptomeria be sapling have sit down and spend their life on a niche or corner of the temple and die pass on the duty of adornment to their son though neither father nor child hop to see the work complete. this question i ask the guide who plunge me in a tangle of daimios and shogun all manifestly extract from a guide book. 
after a while the builder s idea enter into my soul. 
he have say. let u build blood red chapel in a cathedral. so they plant the cathedral three hundred year ago know that tree bole would make the pillar and the sky the roof. 
round each temple stand a small army of priceless bronze or stone lantern stamp a be everything else with the three leaf that make the daimio s crest. the lantern be dark green or lichened grey and in no way lighten the gloom of the red. down below by the sacred bridge i believe red be a joyous colour. up the hillside under the tree and the shadow of the temple eaves i saw that it be the hue of sorrow. when the great king kill the beggar at the ford he do not laugh a i have say. he be very sorry and say. art be art and worth any sacrifice. take that corpse away and pray for the naked soul. once in one of the temple courtyard nature dare to rebel against the scheme of the hillside. some forest tree all unimpressed by the cryptomerias_ have toss a torrent of tender pink flower down the face of a grey retain wall that guard a cut. it be a if a child have laugh aloud at some magnificence it could not understand. 
you see that cat. say the guide point out a pot belly pussy paint above a door. that be the sleep cat. the artist he paint it leave hand. we be proud of that cat. 
and do they let him remain leave hand after he have paint that thing. 
oh yes. you see he be always leave hand. 
the infinite tenderness of the japanese towards their child extend it would seem even to artist. every guide will take you to see the sleep cat. don t go. it be bad. come down the hill i learn that all nikko be two foot under snow in the winter and while i be try to imagine how fierce red white and black green would look under the light of a winter sun i meet the professor murmur expletive of admiration. 
what have you do. what have you see. say he. 
nothing. i ve accumulate a lot of impression of no use to any one but the owner. 
which mean you be go to slop over for the benefit of the people in india say the professor. 
and the notion so disgust me that i leave nikko that very afternoon the guide clamour that i have not see half it glory. there be a lake he say. there be mountain. you must go see. 
i will return to tokio and study the modern side of japan. this place annoy me because i do not understand it. 
yet i be the good guide of yokohama say the guide. 
no. xx. 
show how i grossly libel the japanese army and edit a civil and military gazette which be not in the least trustworthy. 
and the duke say let there be cavalry and there be cavalry. and he say let them be slow and they be slow d d slow. and the japanese imperial horse call he them. 
i be wrong. i know it. i ought to have clamour at the door of the legation for a pas to see the imperial palace. i ought to have investigate tokio and call upon some of the political leader of the liberal and radical party. there be a hundred thing which i ought to have do but somehow or other the bugle begin to blare through the chill of the morning and i hear the tramp of arm men under my window. the parade grind be within a stone s throw of the tokio hotel. the imperial troop be go on parade. would you have bother your head about politics or temple. i run after them. 
it be rather difficult to get accurate information about the japanese army. it seem to be in perpetual throe of reorganisation. at present so far a one can gather it be about one hundred and seventy thousand strong. everybody ha to serve for three year but payment of one hundred dollar will shorten the term of service by one year at least. this be what a man who have go through the mill tell me. he cap his information with this verdict. english army no use. only navy any good. have see two hundred english army. no use. 
on the parade grind they have a company of foot and a wing of what for the sake of brevity i will call cavalry under instruction. the former be be put through some simple evolution in close order. the latter be variously and singularly employ. to the former i take off the hat of respect. at the latter i be ashamed to say i point the finger of derision. but let me try to describe what i saw. the liken of the jap infantryman to the gurkha grow when you see him in bulk. thank to their wholesale system of conscription the quality of conscript vary immensely. i have see score of person with spectacle whom it be base flattery to call soldier and who i hope be in the medical or commissariat department. again i have see dozen of bull neck deep chested flat back thin flank little men who be a good a a colonel command could desire. there be a man of the d infantry whom i meet at an up country railway station. he carry just the proper amount of insolent swagger that a soldier should refuse to answer any question of mine and part the crowd round him without ceremony. a gurkha of the prince of wale own could not have be trim. in the crush of a ticket collect we both get out together i manage to run my hand over that small man s forearm and chest. they must have a very complete system of gymnastics in the japanese army and i would have give much to have strip my friend and see how he peel. if the d infantry be equal to sample they be good. 
the men on parade at tokio belong either to the th or the th and turn out with their cowskin valise strap but i think not pack. under full kit such a i saw on the sentry at osaka castle they ought to be much too heavily burden. their officer be a miserable a set of men a japan could furnish spectacled undersized even for japan hollow back and hump shoulder. they squeak their word of command and have to trot by the side of their men to keep up with them. the jap soldier ha the long stride of the gurkha and he double with the easy lope of the rickshaw coolie. throughout the three hour that i watch them they never change formation but once when they double in pair across the plain their rifle at the carry. their step and interval be a good a those of our native regiment but they wheel rather promiscuously and be not check for this by their officer. so far a my limit experience go their formation be not ours but continental. the word of command be a beautifully unintelligible a anything our parade ground produce. and between them the officer of each half company vehemently harangue their men and shake their sword at em in distinctly unmilitary style. the precision of their movement be beyond praise. they enjoy three hour of steady drill and in the rare interval when they stand easy to draw breath i look for slackness all down the rank inasmuch a stand easy be the crucial test of men after the first smartness of the morning ha wear off. they stand easy neither more nor le but never a hand go to a shoe or stock or button while they be so stand. when they kneel still in this queer column of company i understand the mystery of the long sword bayonet which ha puzzle me sorely. i have expect to see the little fellow lift into the air a the bayonet sheath take grind. but they be not. they kick it sideways a they drop. all the same the authority tie men to the bayonet instead of bayonet to the men. when at the double there be no grab at the cartridge pouch with one hand or steady the bayonet with the other a may be see any day at run fire on indian range. they run cleanly a our gurkha run. 
it be an unchristian think but i would have give a good deal to see that company be blood on an equal number of our native infantry just to know how they would work. if they have pluck and there be not much in their past record to show that they have not they ought to be first class enemy. under british officer instead of the little anatomy at present provide and with a good rifle they should be a good a any troop recruit east of suez. i speak here only for the handy little men i saw. the bad of conscription be that it sweep in such a mass of fourth and fifth rate citizen who though they may carry a gun be likely by their own excusable ineptitude to do harm to the morale and set up of a regiment. in their walk abroad the soldiery never dream of keep step. they tie thing to their side arm they carry bundle they slouch and dirty their uniform. 
and so much for a raw opinion on japanese infantry. the cavalry be have a picnic on the other side of the parade grind circle right and leave by section try to do something with a troop and so forth. i would fain believe that the gentleman i saw be recruit. but they wear all their arm and their officer be just a clever a themselves. half of them be in white fatigue dress and flat cap and wear half boot of brown leather with short hunt spur and black strap. no chain. they carry carbine and sword the sword fix to the man and the carbine sling over the back. no martingale but breastplate and crupper a huge heavy saddle with single hide girth over two numdahs_ complete the equipment which a thirteen hand pony all mane and tail be try to get rid of. when you thrust a two pound bite and bridoon into a small pony s mouth you hurt his feeling. when the rider wear a do my friend white worst glove they cannot take a proper hold of the rein. when they ride with both hand sit well on the mount s neck knuckle level with it ear and the stirrup leather a short a they can be the chance of the pony get rid of the rider be manifestly increase. never have i see such a wild dream of equitation a the tokio parade grind show. do you remember the picture in alice in wonderland_ just before alice find the lion and the unicorn. when she meet the arm men come through the wood. i think of that and i think of the white knight in the same classic and i laugh aloud. here be a set of very fair pony sure foot a goat mostly entire and full of go. under japanese weight they would have make very thorough mount infantry. and here be this blindly imitative nation try to turn them into heavy cavalry. a long a the little beast be gravely trot in circle they do not mind their work. but when it come to slash at the turk s head they object very much indeed. i affiliate myself to a section who arm with long wooden sword be enjoy some turk s head. out start a pony at the gentle of canter while the rider bundle all the rein into one hand and hold his sword like a lance. then the pony shy a little shy shake his shaggy head and begin to passage round the turk s head. there be no pressure of knee or rein to tell him what be want. the man on top begin kick with the spur from shoulder to rump and shake up the ironmongery in the poor brute s mouth. the pony could neither rear nor kick nor buck. but it shake itself free of the incubus who slide off. three time i saw this happen. the catastrophe didn t rise to the dignity of a fall. it be the blunder collapse of incompetence plus worst glove two hand rid and a haystack of equipment. very often the pony go at the post and the man deliver a back hand cut at the turk s head which nearly bring him out of his world too wide saddle. again and again this solemn performance be repeat. i can honestly say that the pony be very will to break rank and leave their companion which be what an english troop horse fail in. but i fancy this be more due to the urgent private affair of the pony than any skill in train. the troop charge once or twice in a terrify canter. when the men wish to stop they lean back and tug and the pony put his head to the grind and bore all he know. they charge me but i be merciful and forebore to empty half the saddle a i assuredly could have do by throw up my arm and yell hi. the sad thing of all be the painful conscientiousness display by all the performer in the circus. they have to turn these rat into cavalry. they know nothing about rid and what they do know be wrong. but the rat must be make troop horse. why wouldn t the scheme work. there be a patient pathetic wonder on the face of the men that make me long to take one of them in my arm and try to explain thing to him bridle for instance and the futility of hang on by the spur. just when the parade be over and the troop be amble off providence send diagonally across the parade grind at a gallop a big rawboned man on a lathy red american horse. the brute crack his nostril and switch his flag abroad and romp across the plain while his rider drop one hand and sit still sway lightly from the hip. the two serve to scale the surround. some one really ought to tell the mikado that pony be never intend for dragoon. 
if the change and chance of military service ever send you against japanese troop be tender with their cavalry. they mean no harm. put some fusee down for the horse to step on and send a fatigue party out to pick up the remnant. but if you meet japanese infantry lead by a continental officer commence fire early and often and at the long range compatible with get at them. they be bad little men who know too much. 
have thoroughly settle the military side of the nation exactly a my japanese friend at the begin of this letter settle u on the strength of two hundred men catch at random i devote myself to a consideration of tokio. i be weary of temple. their monotony of splendour make my head ache. you also will weary of temple unless you be an artist and then you will be disgust with yourself. some folk say that tokio cover an area equal to london. some folk say that it be not more than ten mile long and eight mile broad. there be a good many way of solve the question. i find a tea garden situate on a green plateau far up a flight of step with pretty girl smile on every step. from this elevation i look forth over the city and it stretch away from the sea far a the eye could reach one grey expanse of pack house roof the perspective mark by numberless factory chimney. then i go several mile away and find a park another eminence and some more tea girl pretty than the last. and look again the city stretch out in a new direction a far a the eye could reach. take the scope of the eye on a clear day at eighteen mile i make tokio thirty six mile long by thirty six mile broad exactly. and there may be some more which i miss. the place roar with life through all it quarter. double line of tram run down the main street for mile on mile row of omnibus stand at the principal railway station and the compagnie general de omnibus de tokio parade the street with gold and vermilion car. all the tram be full all the private and public omnibus be full and the street be full of rickshaw. from the sea shore to the shady green park from the park to the dim distance the land pullulate with people. 
here you saw how western civilisation have eat into them. every tenth man be attire in europe clothe from hat to boot. it be a queer race. it can parody every type of humanity to be meet in a large english town. eat and prosperous merchant with mutton chop whisker. mild eye long haired professor of science his clothe baggy about him. schoolboy in eton jacket broadcloth trouser. young clerk member of the clapham athletic club in tennis flannel. artisan in sorely wear tweed. top hat lawyer with clean shave upper lip and black leather bag. sailor out of work. and counter jumper. all these and many many more you shall find in the street of tokio in half an hour s walk. but when you come to speak to the imitation behold it can only talk japanese. you touch it and it be not what you think. i fluctuate down the street address myself to the most english look folk i saw. they be polite with a graciousness that in no way accord with their raiment but they know not a word of my tongue. one small boy in the uniform of the naval college say suddenly. i spik inglees and collapse. the rest of the people in our clothe pour their own vernacular upon my head. yet the shop sign be english the tramway under my foot be english gauge the commodity sell be english and the notice on the street be in english. it be like walk in a dream. i reflect. far away from tokio and off the line of rail i have meet men like these men in the street. perfectly dress englishman to the out eye but dumb. the country must be full of their like. 
good gracious. here be japan go to run it own civilisation without learn a language in which you can say damn satisfactorily. i must inquire into this. 
chance have bring me opposite the office of a newspaper and i run in demand an editor. he come the editor of the tokio public opinion_ a young man in a black frock coat. there be not many editor in other part of the world who would offer you tea and a cigarette ere begin a conversation. my friend have but little english. his paper though the name be print in english be japanese. but he know his business. almost before i have explain my errand which be the pursuit of miscellaneous information he begin. you be english. how you think now the american revision treaty. out come a note book and i sweat cold. it be not in the bargain that he should interview me. 
there s a great deal i answer remember sir roger of bless memory a great deal to be say on both side. the american revision treaty h m demand an enormous amount of mature consideration and may safely be refer. 
but we of japan be now civilise. 
japan say that she be now civilise. that be the crux of the whole matter so far a i understand it. let u have do with the idiotic system of treaty port and passport for the foreigner who step beyond them say japan in effect. give u our place among the civilise nation of the earth come among u trade with u hold land in our midst. only be subject to our jurisdiction and submit to our tariff. now since one or two of the foreign nation have win special tariff for their good in the usual way they be not over anxious to become just ordinary folk. the effect of accept japan s view would be excellent for the individual who want to go up country and make his money but bad for the nation. for our nation in particular. 
all the same i be not prepare to have my ignorance of a burn question put down in any note book save my own. i gladstoned about the matter with the long word i could. my friend record them much after the manner of count smorltork. then i attack him on the subject of civilisation speak very slowly because he have a knack of run two word of mine together and turn them into something new. 
you be right say he. we be become civilise. but not too quick for that be bad. now there be two party in the state the liberal and the radical. one count he lead one one count lead the other. the radical say that we should swiftly become all english. the liberal he say not so quick because that nation which too swiftly adopt other people s custom he decay. that question of civilisation and the american revision treaty he occupy our chief attention. now we be not so zealous to become civilise a we be two three year go. not so quick that be our watchword. yes. 
if mature deliberation be the wholesale adoption of imperfectly understand arrangement i should dearly like to see japan in a hurry. we discuss comparative civilisation for a short time and i protest feebly against the defilement of the street of tokio by row of house build after glare european model. surely there be no need to discard your own architecture i say. 
ha snort the chief of the public opinion. you call it picturesque. i call it too. wait till he light up incendiate. a japanese house then be one only fire box. that be why we think good to build in european fashion. i tell you and you must believe that we take up no change without think upon it. truth indeed it be not because we be curious child want new thing a some people have say. we have do with that season of pick up thing and throw them down again. you see. 
where do you pick up your constitution then. 
i do not know what the question would bring forth yet i ought to have be wise. the first question that a japanese on the railway ask an englishman be. have you get the english translation of our constitution. all the book stall sell it in english and japanese and all the paper discus it. the child be not yet three month old. 
our constitution. that be promise to u promise twenty year ago. fourteen year ago the province they have be allow to elect their big men their head. three year ago they have be allow to have assembly and thus civil liberty be assure. 
i be baffle here for some time. in the end i think i make out that the municipality have be give certain control over police fund and the appointment of district official. i may have be entirely wrong but the editor bore me along on a torrent of word his body rock and his arm wave with the double agony of twist a foreign tongue to his service and explain the to be take seriouslyness of japan. whack come the little hand on the little table and the little tea cup jump again. 
truly and indeed this constitution of ours ha not come too soon. it proceed step by. you understand that. now your constitution the constitution of the foreign nation be all bloody bloody constitution. ours ha come step by. we do not fight a the baron fight with king john at runnymede. 
this be a quotation from a speech deliver at otsu a few day previously by a member of the government. i grin at the brotherhood of editor all the world over. up go the hand anew. 
we shall be happy with this constitution and a people civilise among civilisation. 
of course. but what will you actually do with it. a constitution be rather a monotonous thing to work after the fun of send member to parliament ha die out. you have a parliament have you not. 
oh yes with party liberal and radical. 
then they will both tell lie to you and to each other. then they will pas bill and spend their time fight each other. then all the foreign government will discover that you have no fix policy. 
ah yes. but the constitution. the little hand be cross in his lap. the cigarette hang limply from his mouth. 
no fix policy. then when you have sufficiently disgust the foreign power they will wait until the liberal and radical be fight very hard and then they will blow you out of the water. 
you be not make fun. i do not quite understand say he. your constitution be all so bloody. 
yes. that be exactly what they be. you be very much in earnest about yours be you not. 
oh yes we all talk politics now. 
and write politics of course. by the way under what h m arrangement with the government be a japanese paper publish. i mean must you pay anything before start a press. 
literary scientific and religious paper no. quite free. all purely political paper pay five hundred yen give to the government to keep or else some man say he will pay. 
you must give security you mean. 
i do not know but sometimes the government can keep the money. we be purely political. 
then he ask question about india and appear astonish to find that the native there possess considerable political power and control district. 
but have you a constitution in india. 
i be afraid that we have not. 
ah. 
he crush me there and i leave very humbly but cheer by the promise that the tokio public opinion would contain an account of my word. mercifully that respectable journal be print in japanese so the hash will not be serve up to a large table. i would give a good deal to discover what mean he attach to my forecast of constitutional government in japan. 
we all talk politics now. that be the sentence which remain to me. it be true talk. men of the educational department in tokio tell me that the student would talk politics by the hour if you allow them. at present they be talk in the abstract about their new plaything the constitution with it upper house and it low house it committee it question of supply it rule of procedure and all the other skittle we have play with for six hundred year. 
japan be the second oriental country which ha make it impossible for a strong man to govern alone. this she ha do of her own free will. india on the other hand ha be forcibly ravish by the secretary of state and the english m. p. 
japan be lucky than india. 
no. xxi. 
show the similarity between the babu and the japanese. contain the earnest outcry of an unbeliever. the explanation of mr. smith of california and elsewhere. take me on board ship after due warn to those who follow. 
very sadly do we leave it but we give our heart in pledge to the pine above the city to the blossom by the hedge to the cherry and the maple and the plum tree and the peach and the baby oh the baby. romp fatly under each. eastward ho. across the water see the black bow drive and swing from the land of little child where the baby be the king. 
the professor discover me in meditation amid tea girl at the back of the ueno park in the heart of tokio. my rickshaw coolie sit by my side drink tea from dainty china and eat maccaroons. i think of sterne s donkey and smile vacuously into the blue above the tree. the tea girl giggle. one of them capture my spectacle perch them on her own snubby chubby nose and run about among her cackle fellow. 
and loose thy finger in the tress of the cypress slender minister of wine quote the professor come round a booth suddenly. why aren t you at the mikado s garden party. 
because he didn t invite me and anyhow he wear europe clothe so doe the empress so do all the court people. let s sit down and consider thing. this people puzzle me. 
and i tell my story of the interview with the editor of the tokio public opinion. the professor have be make investigation into the educational department. and further say he at the end of the tale the ambition of the educate student be to get a place under government. therefore he come to tokio. will accept any situation at tokio that he may be near to his chance. 
whose son be that student. 
son of the peasant yeoman farmer and shopkeeper ryot_ tehsildar_ and bunnia. while he wait he imbibe republican leaning on account of the nearness of japan to america. he talk and write and debate and be convince he can manage the empire good than the mikado. 
doe he go away and start newspaper to prove that. 
he may. but it seem to be unwholesome work. a paper can be suspend without reason give under the present law. and i m tell that one enterprising editor ha just get three year simple imprisonment for caricature the mikado. 
then there be yet hope for japan. i can t quite understand how a people with a taste for fight and quick artistic perception can care for the thing that delight our friend in bengal. 
you make the mistake of look on the bengali a unique. so he be in his own peculiar style. but i take it that the drunkenness of western wine affect all oriental folk in much the same way. what mislead you be that very liken. followest thou. because a jap struggle with problem beyond his grip in much the same phraseology a a calcutta university student and discus administration with a capital a you lump jap and chatterjee together. 
no i don t. chatterjee doesn t sink his money in railway company or sit down and provide for the proper sanitation of his own city or of his own notion cultivate the grace of life a the jap doe. he be like the tokio public opinion purely political. he ha no art whatever he ha no weapon and there be no power of manual labour in him. yet he be like the jap in the pathos of his politics. have you ever study pathetic politics. why be he like the jap. 
both drink i suppose say the professor. get that girl to give back your gig lamp and you will be able to see more clearly into the soul of the far east. 
the far east hasn t get a soul. she swap it for a constitution on the eleventh of february last. can any constitution make up for the wear of europe clothe. i saw a jap lady just now in full afternoon call kit. she look atrocious. have you see the late japanese art the picture on the fan and in the shop window. they be faithful reproduction of the change life telegraph pole down the street conventionalise tram line top hat and carpet bag in the hand of the men. the artist can make those thing almost passable but when it come to conventionalise a europe dress the effect be horrible. 
japan wish to take her place among civilise nation say the professor. 
that s where the pathos come in. it s enough to make you weep to watch this misdirect effort this wallow in unloveliness for the sake of recognition at the hand of men who paint their ceiling white their grate black their mantelpiece french grey and their carriage yellow and red. the mikado wear blue and gold and red his guard wear orange breech with a stone blue stripe down them. the american missionary teach the japanese girl to wear bang shingle bang on her forehead plait her hair into a pigtail and to tie it up with magenta and cobalt ribbon. the german sell them the offensive chromos of his own country and the label of his beer bottle. allen and ginter devastate tokio with their blood red and grass green tobacco tin. and in the face of all these thing the country wish to progress toward civilisation. i have read the entire constitution of japan and it be dearly buy at the price of one of the kaleidoscope omnibus ply in the street there. 
be you go to inflict all that nonsense on them at home. say the professor. 
i be. for this reason. in the year to come when japan ha sell her birthright for the privilege of be cheat on equal term by her neighbour. when she ha so heavily run into debt for her railway and public work that the financial assistance of england and annexation be her only help. when the daimios through poverty have sell the treasure of their house to the curio dealer and the dealer ha sell them to the english collector. when all the people wear slop trouser and ready make petticoat and the american have establish soap factory on the river and a board house on the top of fujiyama some one will turn up the file of the pioneer and say. this thing be prophesy. then they will be sorry that they begin tamper with the great sausage machine of civilisation. what be put into the receiver must come out at the spout. but it must come out mincemeat. dixi. and now let u go to the tomb of the forty seven ronins. 
it ha be say some time ago and much good than you can say it say the professor apropos of nothing that i could see. 
distance be calculate by the hour in tokio. forty minute in a rickshaw run at full speed will take you a little way into the city. two hour from the ueno park bring you to the tomb of the famous forty seven pass on the way the very splendid temple of shiba which be all fully describe in the guide book. lacquer gold inlay bronze work and crystal carve with the word om and shri be fine thing to behold but they do not admit of very vary treatment in print. in one tomb of one of the temple be a room of lacquer panel overlay with gold leaf. an animal of the name of v. gay have see fit to scratch his entirely uninteresting name on the gold. posterity will take note that v. gay never cut his fingernail and ought not to have be trust with anything pretty than a hog trough. 
it be the handwrite upon the wall i say. 
presently there will be neither gold nor lacquer nothing but the finger mark of foreigner. let u pray for the soul of v. gay all the same. perhaps he be a missionary. 
* * * * *. 
the japanese paper occasionally contain sandwich between note of railway mine and tram concession announcement like the follow. dr. commit hara kiri last night at his private residence in such and such a street. family complication be assign a the reason of the act. nor doe hara kiri merely mean suicide by any method. hara kiri be hara kiri_ and the private performance be even more ghastly than the official one. it be curious to think that any one of the dapper little men with top hat and reticule who have a constitution of their own may in time of mental stress strip to the waist shake their hair over their brow and after prayer rip themselves open. when you come to japan look at farsari s hara kiri picture and his photo of the last crucifixion. twenty year ago. in japan. then at deakin s inquire for the model head of a gentleman who be not long ago execute in tokio. there be a grim fidelity in the latter work of art that will make you uncomfortable. the japanese in common with the rest of the east have a strain of blood thirstiness in their composition. it be very carefully veil now but some of hokusai s picture show it and show that not long ago the people revel in it outward expression. yet they be tender to all child beyond the tenderness of the west courteous to each other beyond the courtesy of the english and polite to the foreigner alike in the big town and in the mofussil. what they will be after their constitution ha be work for three generation the providence that make them what they be alone know. 
all the world seem ready to proffer them advice. colonel olcott be wander up and down the country now tell them that the buddhist religion need reformation offer to reform it and eat with ostentation rice gruel which be serve to him in cup by admire handmaiden. a wanderer from kioto tell me that in the chion in lovely of all the temple he saw only three day ago the colonel mix up with a procession of buddhist priest just such a procession a the one i try vainly to describe and tramp about a if the whole show belong to him. you cannot appreciate the solemnity of this until you have see the colonel and the chion in temple. the two be build on entirely different line and they don t seem to harmonise. it only need now madame blavatsky cigarette in mouth under the cryptomeria of nikko and the return of mr. caine m. p. to preach the sin of drink saki_ and the menagerie would be full. 
something should be do to america. there be many american missionary in japan and some of them construct clapboard church and chapel for whose ugliness no creed could compensate. they further instil into the japanese mind wicked idea of progress and teach that it be well to go ahead of your neighbour to improve your situation and generally to thresh yourself to piece in the battle of existence. they do not mean to do this. but their own restless energy enforce the lesson. the american be objectionable. and yet this be write from yokohama how pleasant in every way be a nice american whose tongue be cleanse of right there all the time noos revoo raound and the fall cadence. i have meet such an one even now a californian ripen in spain mature in england polish in paris and yet always a californian. his voice and manner be soft alike temperate be his judgment and temperately express wide be his range of experience genuine his humour and fresh from the mint of his mind his reflection. it be only at the end of the conversation that he startle me a little. 
i understand that you be go to stay some time in california. do you mind my give you a little advice. i be speak now of town that be still rather brusque in their manner. when a man offer you a drink accept at once and then stand drink all round. i don t say that the second part of the programme be a necessary a the first but it put you on a perfectly safe foot. above all remember that where you be go you must never carry anything. the men you move among will do that for you. they have be accustom to it. it be in some place unluckily a matter of life and death a well a daily practice to draw first. i have know really lamentable accident occur from a man carry a revolver when he do not know what to do with it. do you understand anything about revolver. 
n no i stammer of course not. 
do you think of carry one. 
of course not. i don t want to kill myself. 
then you be safe. but remember you will be move among men who go heel and you will hear a good deal of talk about the thing and a great many tall story. you may listen to the yarn but you must not conform to the custom however much you may feel tempt. you invite your own death if you lay your hand on a weapon you don t understand. no man flourish a revolver in a bad place. it be produce for one specify purpose and produce before you can wink. 
but surely if you draw first you have an advantage over the other man say i valorously. 
you think so. let me show you. i have no use for any weapon but i believe i have one about me somewhere. an ounce of demonstration be worth a ton of theory. your pipe case be on the table. my hand be on the table too. use that pipe case a a revolver and a quickly a you can. 
i use it in the approve style of the penny dreadful point it with a stiff arm at my friend s head. before i know how it come about the pipe case have quit my hand which be catch close to the funny bone and tingle horribly. i hear four persuasive click under the table almost before i know that my arm be useless. the gentleman from california have jerk out his pistol from it pocket and draw the trigger four time his hand rest on his hip while i be lift my right arm. 
now do you believe. he say. only an englishman or an eastern man fire from the shoulder in that melodramatic manner. i have you safe before your arm go out merely because i happen to know the trick. and there be men out yonder who in a trouble could hold me a safe a i hold you. they don t reach round for their revolver a novelist say. it s here in front close to the second right brace button and it be fire without aim at the other man s stomach. you will understand now why in event of a dispute you should show very clearly that you be unarm. you needn t hold up your hand ostentatiously. keep them out of your pocket or somewhere where your friend can see them. no man will touch you then. or if he doe he be pretty sure to be shoot by the general sense of the room. 
that must be a singular consolation to the corpse i say. 
i see i ve mislead you. don t fancy that any part in america be a free and easy a my lecture show. only in a few really tough town do you require not to own a revolver. elsewhere you be all right. most american of my acquaintance have get into the habit of carry something. but it s only a habit. they d never dream of use it unless they be hard press. it s the man who draw to enforce a proposition about can peach orange culture or town lot or water right that s a nuisance. 
thank you i say faintly. i purpose to investigate these thing late on. i m much oblige to you for your advice. 
when he have depart it strike me that in the language of the east he might have be pull my leg. but there remain no doubt whatever a to his skill with the weapon he excuse so tenderly. 
i put the case before the professor. we will go to america before you forejudge it altogether say he. to america in an american ship will we go and say good by to japan. that night we count the gain of our sojourn in the land of little child more closely than many men count their silver. nagasaki with the grey temple green hill and all the wonder of a first see shore. the inland sea a thirty hour panorama of pass islet draw in grey and buff and silver for our delight. kob√© where we feed well and go to a theatre. osaka of the canal and the peach blossom. kioto happy lazy sumptuous kioto and the blue rapid and innocent delight of arashima. otzu on the shoreless rainy lake. myanoshita in the hill. kamakura by the tumble pacific where the great god buddha sit and equably hear the century and the sea murmur in his ear. nikko fair of all place under the sun. tokio the two third civilise and altogether progressive warren of humanity. and composite franco american yokohama. we renew them all sort out and put aside our special treasure of memory. if we stay long we might be disillusion and yet surely that would be impossible. 
what sort of mental impression do you carry away. say the professor. 
a tea girl in fawn colour cr√™pe under a cherry tree all blossom. behind her green pine two baby and a hog back bridge span a bottle green river run over blue boulder. in the foreground a little policeman in badly fit europe clothe drink tea from blue and white china on a black lacquer stand. fleecy white cloud above and a cold wind up the street i say summarise hastily. 
mine be a little different. a japanese boy in a flat head german cap and baggy eton jacket. a king take out of a toy shop a railway take out of a toy shop hundred of little noah s ark tree and field make of green paint wood. the whole neatly pack in a camphor wood box with an explanatory book call the constitution price twenty cent. 
you look on the dark side of thing. but what s the good of write impression. every man ha to get his own at first hand. suppose i give an itinerary of what we saw. 
you couldn t do it say the professor blandly. besides by the time the next anglo indian come this way there will be a hundred more mile of railway and all the local arrangement will have change. write that a man should come to japan without any plan. the guide book will tell him a little and the men he meet will tell him ten time more. let him get first a good guide at kob√© and the rest will come easily enough. an itinerary be only a fresh manifestation of that unbridle egoism which. 
i shall write that a man can do himself well from calcutta to yokohama stop at rangoon moulmein penang singapur hong kong canton and take a month in japan for about sixty pound rather le than more. but if he begin to buy curio that man be lose. five hundred rupee cover his month in japan and allow him every luxury. above all he should bring with him thousand of cheroot enough to serve him till he reach frisco. singapur be the last place on the line where you can buy burma. beyond that point wicked men sell manila cigar with fancy name for ten and havana for thirty five cent. no one inspect your box till you reach frisco. bring therefore at least one thousand cheroot. 
do you know it seem to me you have a very queer sense of proportion. 
and that be the last word the professor speak on japanese soil. 
no. xxii. 
show how i come to america before my time and be much shake in body and soul.

this be america. they call her the city of peking_ and she belong to the pacific mail company but for all practical purpose she be the unite state. we be divide between missionary and general general who be at vicksburg and shiloh and german by birth but more american than the american who in confidence tell you that they be not general at all but only brevet major of militia corp. the missionary be perhaps the queer portion of the cargo. do you ever hear an english minister lecture for half an hour on the freight traffic receipt and general work of let u say the midland. the professor ha be sit at the foot of a keen eye close beard swarthy man who expound unto him kindred mystery with a fluency and precision that a city leader writer might have envy. who s your financial friend with the figure at his finger end. i ask. missionary presbyterian mission to the jap say the professor. i lay my hand upon my mouth and be dumb. 
a a counterpoise to the missionary we carry men from manila lean scotchman who gamble once a month in the manila state lottery and occasionally turn up trump. one at least draw a ten thousand dollar prize last december and be away to make merry in the new world. everybody on the staff of an american steamer this side the continent seem to gamble steadily in that lottery and the talk of the smoke room run almost entirely on prize win by accident or lose through a moment s delay. the ticket be sell more or le openly at yokahama and hong kong and the drawing loser and winner both agree here be above reproach. 
we have resign ourselves to the infinite monotony of a twenty day voyage. the pacific mail advertise falsely. only under the most favorable circumstance of wind and steam can their under engined boat cover the distance in fifteen day. our city of peking_ for instance have be jog along at a gentle ten knot an hour a pace out of all proportion to her bulk. when we get a wind say the captain we shall do good. she be a four master and can carry any amount of canvas. it be not safe to run steamer across this void under the pole of atlantic liner. the monotony of the sea be paralyse. we have pass the wreck of a little seal schooner lie bottom up and cover with gull. she welter by in the chill dawn unlovely a the corpse of a man and the wild bird pip thinly at u a they steer her across the surge. the pulse of the pacific be no little thing even in the quiet mood of the sea. it set our bow swing and nose and duck ere we be a day clear of yokohama and yet there be never swell nor crest wave in sight. we ride very high say the captain and she s a dry boat. she ha a knack of crawl over thing somehow. but we shan t need to put her to the test this journey. 
* * * * *. 
the captain be mistake. for four day we have endure the sullen displeasure of the north pacific wind up with a night of discomfort. it begin with a grey sea fly cloud and a head wind that smite fifty knot off the day s run. then rise from the southeast a beam sea warrant by no wind that be abroad upon the water in our neighbourhood and we wallow in the trough of it for sixteen mortal hour. in the stillness of the harbour when the newspaper man be lunch in her saloon and the steam launch be crawl round her side a ship of pride be a stately liner. out in the open one rugged shoulder of a sea between you and the horizon she become the old hooker a lively boat and other thing of small import for this be necessary to propitiate the ocean. there s a storm to the southeast of u explain the captain. that s what s kick up this sea. 
the city of peking do not belie her reputation. she crawl over the sea in lively wise never ship a bucket till she be force to. then she take it green over the bow to the vast edification of at least one passenger who have never see the scupper full before. 
late in the day the fun begin. oh she s a daisy at roll murmur the chief steward fling starfish wise on a table among his glassware. she s roll some say a black apparition new rise from the stoke hold. be she go to roll any more. demand the lady group in what ought to have be the lady saloon but accord to american custom be label social hall. 
pass in the twilight the chief officer a drip beard face. shall i mark out the bull board. say he and lurch aft follow by the tongue of a wave. she ll roll her guard under to night say a man from louisiana where their river steamer do not understand the mean of bulwark. we din to a dash accompaniment of crockery the bound of emancipate beer bottle lively than their own cork and the clamour of the ship s gong break loose and call to meal on it own account. 
after dinner the real roll begin. she do roll guard under a the louisiana man have prophesy. at thirty minute interval to the second arrive one big sea when the electric lamp die down to nothing and the screw rave and the blow of the sea make the deck quiver. on those occasion we move from our chair not gently but discourteously. at other time we be merely hold on with both hand. 
it be then that i study fear terror bind in black silk and fight hard with herself. for reason which will be thoroughly understand there be a tendency among the passenger to herd together and to address inquiry to every officer who happen to stagger through the saloon. no one be in the least alarm oh dear no. but all be keenly anxious for information. this anxiety redouble after a more than usually vicious roll. terror be a large handsome and culture lady who know the precise value of human life the inwardness of robert elsmere_ the late poetry everything in fact that a clever woman should know. when the roll be near it bad she begin to talk swiftly. i do not for a moment believe that she know what she be talk about. the roll increase. she buckle down to the task of make conversation. by the heave of the labour bust the restless work of the finger on the tablecloth and the uncontrollable eye that turn always to the companion stairhead i be able to judge the extremity of her fear. yet her word be frivolous and commonplace enough. they pour forth unceasingly punctuate with little laugh and giggle a a woman s speech should be. presently a member of her group suggest go to bed. no she want to sit up. she want to go on talk and a long a she could get a soul to sit with her she have her desire. when for sheer lack of company she be force to get to her cabin she leave reluctantly look back to the well light saloon over her shoulder. the contrast between the flow triviality of her speech and the strain intentness of eye and hand be a quaint thing to behold. i know now how fear should be paint. 
no one sleep very heavily that night. both arm be need to grip the berth while the trunk below wind the carpet slip into knot and batter the frame of the cabin. once it seem to me that the whole of the labour fabric that case our trumpery fortune stand on end and in this undignified posture hop a mighty hop. twice i know i shoot out of my berth to join the adventurous trunk on the floor. a hundred time the crash of the wave on the ship s side be follow by the roar of the water a it sweep the deck and rave round the deckhouses. in a lull i hear the fly foot of a man a shout and a far away chorus of lose spirit sing somebody s requiem. 
may. queen s birthday. if ever you meet an american be good to him. this day the ship be dress with flag from stem to stern and chief of the bunt be the union jack. they have give no word of warn to the english who be proportionately please. at dinner up rise an ex commissioner of the lucknow division. on my honour anglo india extend to the end of the earth. and give u the health of her majesty and the president. it be afterwards that the trouble begin. a small american pen half a dozen english into a corner and lecture them soundly on their want of patriotism. 
what sort of queen s birthday do you call this. he thunder. what do you drink our president s health for. what s the president to you on this day of all others. well suppose you be in the minority all the more reason for stand by your country. don t talk to me. you britisher make a mess of it a mighty bungle of the whole thing. i m an american of the american. but if no one can propose her majesty s health good than by just throw it at your head i m go to try. 
then and there he deliver a remarkably neat little oration pat well put together and clearly deliver. so it come to pas that the queen s health be best honour by an american. we english be daze. i wonder how many englishman not train to address their fellow would have speak half so fluently a the gentleman from frisco. 
well you see say one of u feebly she s our queen anyhow and and she s be ours for fifty year and not one of u here ha see england for seven year and we can t enthuse over the matter. we ve live to be haul over the coal for want of patriotism by an american. we ll be more careful next time. 
and the conversation drift naturally into the question of the government of men english japanese. we have several travel japanese aboard. and american throw the ball from one to another. we bore in mind the golden rule. never agree with a man who abuse his own country and get on well enough. 
japan say a little gentleman who be a rich man there japan be divide into two administrative side. on the one the remain of a very strict and quite oriental despotism. on the other a mass of what do you call it. red tapeism which be not understand even by the official who handle it. we copy the red tape and when it be copy we believe that we administer. that be a vice of all oriental nation. we be oriental. 
oh no say the most westerly of the western purr an american soothingly. 
the little man be please. thank. that be what we hope to believe but up to the present it be not so. look now. a farmer in my country hold a hillside cut into little terrace. every year he must submit to his government a statement of the size and revenue pay not on the whole hillside but on each terrace. the complete statement make a pile three inch high and be of no use when it be make except to keep in work thousand of official to check the return. be that administration. by god. we call it so but we multiply official by the twenty and they be not administration. what country be such a fool. look at our government office eat up with clerk. some day i tell you there will be a smash. 
this be new to me but i might have guess it. in every country where sword and uniform accompany civil office there be a natural tendency towards an ill consider increase of officialdom. 
you might pay india a visit some day i say. i fancy that you would find that our country share your trouble. 
thereupon a japanese gentleman in the educational department begin to cross question me on the matter of his craft in india and in a quarter of an hour get from me the very little that i know about primary school high education and the value of an m. a. degree. he know exactly what he want to ask and only drop me when the tooth of desire have clean pick the bone of ignorance. 
then an american hold forth harp on a string that ha already be too often twang in my ear. what will it be in america itself. 
the whole system be rotten from top to bottom he say. a rotten a rotten can be. 
that s so say the louisiana man with an affirmative puff of smoke. 
they call u a republic. we may be. i don t think it. you britisher have get the only republic worth the name. you choose to run your ship of state with a gild figurehead. but i know and so doe every man who ha think about it that your queen doesn t cost you one half what our system of pure democracy cost u. politics in america. there aren t any. the whole question of the day be spoil. that s all. we fight our soul out over tram contract gas contract road contract and any darn thing that will turn a dishonest dollar and we call that politics. no one but a low down man will run for congress and the senate the senate of the free people on earth be bind slave to some bless monopoly. if i have money enough i could buy the senate of the unite state the eagle and the star spangle banner complete. 
and the irish vote include. say some one a britisher i fancy. 
certainly if i choose to go yahooing down the street at the tail of the british lion. anything dirty will buy the irish vote. that s why our politics be dirty. some day you britisher will grant home rule to the vermin in our blanket. then the real american will invite the irish to get up and git to where they come from. wish you d hurry up that time before we have another trouble. we re bind hand and foot by the irish vote. or at least that s the excuse for any unusual theft that we perpetrate. i tell you there s no good in an irishman except a a fighter. he doesn t understand work. he ha a natural gift of the gab and he can drink a man blind. these three qualification make him a first class politician. 
with one accord the american present commence to abuse ireland and it people a they have meet them and each man preface his commination service with. i be an american by birth an american from way back. 
it must be an awful thing to live in a country where you have to explain that you really belong there. loud grow the clamour and crisp the sentiment. 
if we weren t among american i should say we be consort with russian say a fellow countryman in my ear. 
they can t mean what they say i whisper. listen to this fellow. he be say. 
and i know for i have be three time round the world and reside in most country on the continent that there be never people yet could govern themselves. 
allah. this from an american. 
and who should know good than an american. be the retort. for the ignorant that be to say for the majority there be only one argument fear. the fear of death. in our case we give any scallawag who come across the water all the same privilege that we have make for ourselves. there we make a mistake. they thank u by play the fool. then we shoot them down. you can t persuade the mob of any country to become decent citizen. if they misbehave themselves shoot them. i saw the bomb throw at chicago when our police be blow to bit. i saw the banner in the procession that throw the bomb. all the motto on them be in german. the men be alien in our midst and they be shoot down like dog. i ve be in labour riot and see the militia go through a crowd like a finger through tissue paper. 
i be in the riot at new orleans say the man from louisiana. we turn the gatling on the other crowd and they be sick. 
whew. i wonder what would have happen if a gatling have be use when the west end riot be in full swing. say an englishman. if a single rioter be kill in an english town by the police the chance be that the policeman would have to stand his trial for murder and the ministry of the day would go out. 
then you ve get all your trouble before you. the more power you give the people the more trouble they will give. with u our good class be corrupt and our low class be lawless. there be million of useful law abide citizen and they be very sick of this thing. we execute our justice in the street. the law court be no use. take the case of the chicago anarchist. it be all we could do to get em hang. whereas the dead in the street have be punish off hand. we be sure of them. guess that s the reason we be so quick to fire on a mob. but it s unfair all the same. we receive all these cattle anarchist socialist and ruffian of every sort and then we shoot them. the state be a republican a they make em. we have no use for a man who want to try any more experiment on the constitution. we be the big people on god s earth. all the world know that. we ve be shout that we be also the great people. no one care to contradict u but ourselves. and we be now wonder whether we be what we claim to be. never mind. you britisher will have the same experience to go through. you re begin to rot now. your county council will make you more rotten because you be put power into the hand of untrained people. when you reach our level every man with a vote and the right to sell it. the right to nominate fellow of his own kidney to swamp out good men you ll be what we be now rotten rotten rotten. 
the voice cease and no man rise up to contradict. 
we ll worry through it somehow say the man from louisiana. what would do u a world of good now would be a big european war. we re get slack and sprawly. now a war outside our border would make u all pull together. but that s a luxury we shan t get. 
can t you raise one within your own border. i say flippantly to get rid of the think of the great blind nation in her unrest put out her hand to the sword. mine be a most unfortunate remark. 
i hope not say an american very seriously. we have pay a good deal to keep ourselves together before this and it be not likely that we shall split up without protest. yet some say we be too large and some say that washington and the eastern state be run the whole country. if ever we do divide god help u when we do it will be east and west this time. 
we build the old hooker too long in the run. we put the engine room aft. break her back say an american who have not yet speak. wonder if our forbear know how she be go to grow. 
a very large country. the speaker sigh a though the weight of it from new york to frisco lay upon his shoulder. if ever we do divide it mean that we be do for. there be no room for four first class empire in the state. one split will lead to another if the first be successful. what s the use of talk. 
what be the use. here s our conversation a it run the night of the queen s birthday. what do you think. 
no. xxiii. 
how i get to san francisco and take tea with the native there. 
serene indifferent to fate thou sittest at the western gate thou seest the white sea fold their tent oh warder of two continent. thou drawest all thing small and great to thee beside the western gate. 
this be what bret harte ha write of the great city of san francisco and for the past fortnight i have be wonder what make him do it. there be neither serenity nor indifference to be find in these part. and evil would it be for the continent whose wardship be intrust to so reckless a guardian. behold me pitch neck and crop from twenty day of the high sea into the whirl of california deprive of any guidance and leave to draw my own conclusion. protect me from the wrath of an outrage community if these letter be ever read by american eye. san francisco be a mad city inhabit for the most part by perfectly insane people whose woman be of a remarkable beauty. when the city of peking steam through the golden gate i saw with great joy that the block house which guard the mouth of the fine harbour in the world sir could be silence by two gunboat from hong kong with safety comfort and despatch. 
then a reporter leap aboard and ere i could gasp hold me in his toil. he pump me exhaustively while i be get ashore demand of all thing in the world news about indian journalism. it be an awful thing to enter a new land with a new lie on your lip. i speak the truth to the evil mind custom house man who turn my most sacred raiment on a floor compose of stable refuse and pine splinter. but the reporter overwhelm me not so much by his poignant audacity a his beautiful ignorance. i be sorry now that i do not tell him more lie a i pass into a city of three hundred thousand white men. think of it. three hundred thousand white men and woman gather in one spot walk upon real pavement in front of real plate glass windowed shop and talk something that be not very different from english. it be only when i have tangle myself up in a hopeless maze of small wooden house dust street refuse and child who play with empty kerosene tin that i discover the difference of speech. 
you want to go to the palace hotel. say an affable youth on a dray. what in hell be you do here then. this be about the low place in the city. go six block north to corner of geary and market. then walk around till you strike corner of gutter and sixteenth and that bring you there. 
i do not vouch for the literal accuracy of these direction quote but from a disorder memory. 
amen i say. but who be i that i should strike the corner of such a you name. peradventure they be gentleman of repute and might hit back. bring it down to dot my son. 
i think he would have smite me but he didn t. he explain that no one ever use the word street and that every one be suppose to know how the street run. for sometimes the name be upon the lamp and sometimes they weren t. fortify with these direction i proceed till i find a mighty street full of sumptuous building four or five story high but pave with rude cobble stone in the fashion of the year one. a cable car without any visible mean of support slide stealthily behind me and nearly strike me in the back. a hundred yard further there be a slight commotion in the street a gather together of three or four and something that glitter a it move very swiftly. a ponderous irish gentleman with priest s cord in his hat and a small nickel plat badge on his fat bosom emerge from the knot support a chinaman who have be stab in the eye and be bleed like a pig. the bystander go their way and the chinaman assist by the policeman his own. of course this be none of my business but i rather want to know what have happen to the gentleman who have deal the stab. it say a great deal for the excellence of the municipal arrangement of the town that a surge crowd do not at once block the street to see what be go forward. i be the sixth man and the last who assist at the performance and my curiosity be six time the great. indeed i felt ashamed of show it. 
there be no more incident till i reach the palace hotel a seven storied warren of humanity with a thousand room in it. all the travel book will tell you about hotel arrangement in this country. they should be see to be appreciate. understand clearly and this letter be write after a thousand mile of experience that money will not buy you service in the west. 
when the hotel clerk the man who award your room to you and who be suppose to give you information when that resplendent individual stoop to attend to your want he doe so whistle or hum or pick his teeth or pause to converse with some one he know. these performance i gather be to impress upon you that he be a free man and your equal. from his general appearance and the size of his diamond he ought to be your superior. there be no necessity for this swagger self consciousness of freedom. business be business and the man who be pay to attend to a man might reasonably devote his whole attention to the job. 
in a vast marble pave hall under the glare of an electric light sit forty or fifty men. and for their use and amusement be provide spittoon of infinite capacity and generous gape. most of the men wear frock coat and top hat the thing that we in india put on at a wed breakfast if we possess them but they all spat. they spat on principle. the spittoon be on the staircase in each bedroom yea and in chamber even more sacred than these. they chase one into retirement but they blossom in chief splendour round the bar and they be all use every reek one of em. just before i begin to feel deathly sick another reporter grapple me. what he want to know be the precise area of india in square mile. i refer him to whittaker. he have never hear of whittaker. he want it from my own mouth and i would not tell him. then he swerve off like the other man to detail of journalism in our own country. i venture to suggest that the interior economy of a paper most concern the people who work it. that s the very thing that interest u he say. have you get reporter anything like our reporter on indian news paper. we have not i say and suppress the thank god rise to my lip. _why haven t you. say he. because they would die i say. it be exactly like talk to a child a very rude little child. he would begin almost every sentence with. now tell me something about india and would turn aimlessly from one question to another without the least continuity. i be not angry but keenly interest. the man be a revelation to me. to his question i return answer mendacious and evasive. after all it really do not matter what i say. he could not understand. i can only hope and pray that none of the reader of the pioneer will ever see that portentous interview. the man make me out to be an idiot several size more drivel than my destiny intend and the rankness of his ignorance manage to distort the few poor fact with which i supply him into large and elaborate lie. then think i. the matter of american journalism shall be look into late on. at present i will enjoy myself. 
no man rise to tell me what be the lion of the place. no one volunteer any sort of conveyance. i be absolutely alone in this big city of white folk. by instinct i seek refreshment and come upon a bar room full of bad salon picture in which men with hat on the back of their head be wolf food from a counter. it be the institution of the free lunch that i have strike. you pay for a drink and get a much a you want to eat. for something le than a rupee a day a man can fee himself sumptuously in san francisco even though he be bankrupt. remember this if ever you be strand in these part. 
late i begin a vast but unsystematic exploration of the street. i ask for no name. it be enough that the pavement be full of white men and woman the street clang with traffic and that the restful roar of a great city ring in my ear. the cable car glide to all point of the compass. i take them one by one till i could go no farther. san francisco ha be pitch down on the sand bunker of the bikaneer desert. about one fourth of it be grind reclaim from the sea any old timer will tell you all about that. the remainder be rag unthrifty sand hill peg down by house. 
from an english point of view there ha not be the least attempt at grade those hill and indeed you might a well try to grade the hillock of sind. the cable car have for all practical purpose make san francisco a dead level. they take no count of rise or fall but slide equably on their appoint course from one end to the other of a six mile street. they turn corner almost at right angle. cross other line and for aught i know may run up the side of house. there be no visible agency of their flight. but once in a while you shall pas a five storied build hum with machinery that wind up an everlasting wire cable and the initiate will tell you that here be the mechanism. i give up ask question. if it plea providence to make a car run up and down a slit in the grind for many mile and if for twopence halfpenny i can ride in that car why shall i seek the reason of the miracle. rather let me look out of the window till the shop give place to thousand and thousand of little house make of wood each house just big enough for a man and his family. let me watch the people in the car and try to find out in what manner they differ from u their ancestor. they delude themselves into the belief that they talk english the english and i have already be pity for speak with an english accent. the man who pity me speak so far a i be concern the language of thief. and they all do. where we put the accent forward they throw it back and vice versa. where we use the long a_ they use the short. and word so simple a to be past mistake they pronounce somewhere up in the dome of their head. how do these thing happen. oliver wendell holmes say that yankee schoolmarm the cider and the salt codfish of the eastern state be responsible for what he call a nasal accent. a hindu be a hindu and a brother to the man who know his vernacular. and a frenchman be french because he speak his own language. but the american ha no language. he be dialect slang provincialism accent and so forth. now that i have hear their voice all the beauty of bret harte be be ruin for me because i find myself catch through the roll of his rhythmical prose the cadence of his peculiar fatherland. get an american lady to read to you how santa claus come to simpson s bar and see how much be under her tongue leave of the beauty of the original. 
but i be sorry for bret harte. it happen this way. a reporter ask me what i think of the city and i make answer suavely that it be hallow grind to me because of bret harte. that be true. well say the reporter bret harte claim california but california don t claim bret harte. he s be so long in england that he s quite english. have you see our cracker factory and the new office of the examiner. he could not understand that to the outside world the city be worth a great deal le than the man. 
* * * * *. 
night fell over the pacific and the white sea fog whip through the street dim the splendour of the electric light. it be the use of this city her men and woman to parade between the hour of eight and ten a certain street call kearney street where the fine shop be situate. here the click of heel on the pavement be loud here the light be bright and here the thunder of the traffic be most overwhelm. i watch young california and saw that it be at least expensively dress cheerful in manner and self assert in conversation. also the woman be very fair. the maiden be of generous build large well groom and attire in raiment that even to my inexperienced eye must have cost much. kearney street at nine o clock level all distinction of rank a impartially a the grave. again and again i loiter at the heel of a couple of resplendent being only to overhear when i expect the level voice of culture the staccato sez he sez i that be the mark of the white servant girl all the world over. 
this be depress because in spite of all that go to the contrary fine feather ought to make fine bird. there be wealth unlimited wealth in the street but not an accent that would not have be dear at fifty cent. wherefore revolve in my mind that these folk be barbarian i be presently enlighten and make aware that they also be the heir of all the age and civilise after all. there appear before me an affable strange of prepossess appearance with a blue and an innocent eye. address me by name he claim to have meet me in new york at the windsor and to this claim i give a qualify assent. i do not remember the fact but since he be so certain of it why then i wait development. and what do you think of indiana when you come through. be the next question. it reveal the mystery of previous acquaintance and one or two other thing. with reprehensible carelessness my friend of the light blue eye have look up the name of his victim in the hotel register and read india for indiana. he could not imagine an englishman come through the state from west to east instead of by the regularly ordain route. my fear be that in his delight at find me so responsive he would make remark about new york and the windsor which i could not understand. and indeed he adventure in this direction once or twice ask me what i think of such and such street which from his tone i gather be anything but respectable. it be try to talk unknown new york in almost unknown san francisco. but my friend be merciful. he protest that i be one after his own heart and press upon me rare and curious drink at more than one bar. these drink i accept with gratitude a also the cigar with which his pocket be store. he would show me the life of the city. have no desire to watch a weary old play again i evade the offer and receive in lieu of the devil s instruction much coarse flattery. curiously constitute be the soul of man. know how and where this man lie wait idly for the finale i be distinctly conscious a he bubble compliment in my ear of soft thrill of gratify pride. i be wise quoth he anybody could see that with half an eye. sagacious. verse in the affair of the world. an acquaintance to be desire. one who have taste the cup of life with discretion. all this please me and in a measure numb the suspicion that be thoroughly arouse. eventually the blue eye one discover nay insist that i have a taste for card. this be clumsily work in but it be my fault in that i meet him half way and allow him no chance of good act. hereupon i lay my head to one side and simulate unholy wisdom quote odds and end of poker talk all ludicrously misapply. my friend keep his countenance admirably. and well he might for five minute late we arrive always by the pure of chance at a place where we could play card and also frivol with louisiana state lottery ticket. would i play. nay say i for to me card have neither mean nor continuity. but let u assume that i be go to play. how would you and your friend get to work. would you play a straight game or make me drink or well the fact be i m a newspaper man and i d be much oblige if you d let me know something about bunco steer. my blue eye friend curse me by his god the right and the leave bower. he even curse the very good cigar he have give me. but the storm over he quiet down and explain. i apologise for cause him to waste an even and we spend a very pleasant time together. inaccuracy provincialism and a too hasty rush to conclusion be the rock that he have split on. but he get his revenge when he say. how would i play with you. from all the poppycock. anglice_ bosh. you talk about poker i d ha play a straight game and skin you. i wouldn t have take the trouble to make you drink. you never know anything of the game. but the way i be mistake in you make me sick. he glare at me a though i have do him an injury. to day i know how it be that year after year week after week the bunco steerer who be the confidence trick and the card sharp man of other clime secure his prey. he slaver them over with flattery a the snake slaver the rabbit. the incident depress me because it show i have leave the innocent east far behind and be come to a country where a man must look out for himself. the very hotel bristle with notice about keep my door lock and deposit my valuable in a safe. the white man in a lump be bad. weep softly for o toyo. little i know then that my heart be to be tear afresh from my bosom. i fell asleep in the clang hotel. 
next morning i have enter upon the defer inheritance. there be no prince in america at least with crown on their head but a generous mind member of some royal family receive my letter of introduction. ere the day close i be a member of the two club and book for many engagement to dinner and party. now this prince upon whose financial operation be continual increase have no reason nor have the others his friend to put himself out for the sake of one briton more or le. but he rest not till he have accomplish all in my behalf that a mother could think of for her d√©butante daughter. do you know the bohemian club of san francisco. they say it fame extend over the world. it be create somewhat on the line of the savage by men who write or draw thing and it ha blossom into most unrepublican luxury. the ruler of the place be an owl an owl stand upon a skull and cross bone show forth grimly the wisdom of the man of letter and the end of his hope for immortality. the owl stand on the staircase a statue four foot high be carve in the woodwork flutter on the fresco ceiling be stamp on the note paper and hang on the wall. he be an ancient and honourable bird. under his wing twas my privilege to meet with white men whose life be not chain down to routine of toil who write magazine article instead of read them hurriedly in the pause of office work who paint picture instead of content themselves with cheap etching pick up at another man s sale of effect. mine be all the right of social intercourse that india stony hearted step mother of collector ha swindle u out of. tread soft carpet and breathe the incense of superior cigar i wander from room to room study the painting in which the member of the club have caricature themselves their associate and their aim. there be a slick french audacity about the workmanship of these men of toil unbend that go straight to the heart of the beholder. and yet it be not altogether french. a dry grimness of treatment almost dutch mark the difference. the men paint a they speak with certainty. the club indulge in revelry which it call jinks high and low at interval and each of these gathering be faithfully portray in oil by hand that know their business. in this club be no amateur spoil canvas because they fancy they could handle oil without knowledge of shadow or anatomy no gentleman of leisure ruin the temper of publisher and an already ruin market with attempt to write because everybody write something these day. my host be work or have work for their daily bread with pen or paint and their talk for the most part be of the shop shoppy that be to say delightful. they extend a large hand of welcome and be a brother and i do homage to the owl and listen to their talk. an indian club about christmas time will yield if properly work an abundant harvest of queer tale. but at a gather of american from the uttermost end of their own continent the tale be large thick more spinous and even more azure than any indian variety. tale of the war i hear tell by an ex officer of the south over his even drink to a colonel of the northern army. my introducer who have serve a a trooper in the northern horse throw in emendation from time to time. 
other voice follow with equally wondrous tale of riata throw in mexico or arizona of gamble at army post in texas of newspaper war wag in godless chicago of death sudden and violent in montana and dakota of the love of half breed maiden in the south and fantastic hunting for gold in mysterious alaska. above all they tell the story of the build of old san francisco when the fine collection of humanity on god s earth sir start this town and the water come up to the foot of market street. very terrible be some of the tale grimly humorous the others and the men in broadcloth and fine linen who tell them have play their part in them. 
and now and again when thing get too bad they would toll the city bell and the vigilance committee turn out and hang the suspicious character. a man didn t begin to be suspect in those day till he have commit at least one unprovoked murder say a calm eye portly old gentleman. i look at the picture around me the noiseless neat uniform waiter behind me the oak rib ceiling above the velvety carpet beneath. it be hard to realise that even twenty year ago you could see a man hang with great pomp. late on i find reason to change my opinion. the tale give me a headache and set me think. how in the world be it possible to take in even one thousandth of this huge roar many side continent. in the silence of the sumptuous library lay professor bryce s book on the american republic. it be an omen say i. he ha do all thing in all seriousness and he may be purchase for half a guinea. those who desire information of the most undoubted must refer to his page. for me be the daily round of vagabondage the record of the incident of the hour and talk with the travel companion of the day. i will not do this country at all. 
and i forget all about india for ten day while i go out to dinner and watch the social custom of the people which be entirely different from our custom and be introduce to the men of many million. these person be harmless in their early stage. that be to say a man worth three or four million dollar may be a good talker clever amuse and of the world. a man with twice that amount be to be avoid. and a twenty million man be just twenty million. take an instance. i be speak to a newspaper man about see the proprietor of his journal. my friend snort indignantly. see him. great scott. no. if he happen to appear in the office i have to associate with him. but thank heaven outside of that i move in circle where he cannot come. 
and yet the first thing i have be teach to believe be that money be everything in america. 
no. xxiv. 
show how through folly i assist at a murder and be afraid. the rule of the democracy and the despotism of the alien. 
poor men god make and all for that. 
it be a bad business throughout and the only consolation be that it be all my fault. a man take me round the chinese quarter of san francisco which be a ward of the city of canton set down in the most eligible business quarter of the place. the chinaman with his usual skill ha possess himself of good brick fire proof building and follow instinct ha pack each tenement with hundred of soul all live in filth and squalor not to be appreciate save by you in india. that cursory investigation ought to have suffice. but i want to know how deep in the earth the pig tail have take root. therefore i explore the chinese quarter a second time and alone which be foolishness. no one in the filthy street. but for the bless sea breeze san francisco would enjoy cholera every season. interfere with my movement though many ask for cumshaw. i strike a house about four story high full of celestial abomination and begin to burrow down. have hear that these tenement be construct on the line of iceberg two third below sight level. downstairs i crawl past chinaman in bunk opium smoker brothel and gamble hell till i have reach the second cellar be in fact in the labyrinth of a warren. great be the wisdom of the chinaman. in time of trouble that house could be raze to the grind by the mob and yet hide all it inhabitant in brick wall and wooden beam subterranean gallery strengthen with iron frame door and gate. on the second underground floor a man ask for cumshaw and take me downstairs to yet another cellar where the air be a thick a butter and the lamp burn little hole in it not more than an inch square. in this place a poker club have assemble and be in full swing. the chinaman love pokel and play it with great skill swear like a cat when he lose. most of the men round the table be in semi european dress their pigtail curl up under billy cock hat. one of the company look like a eurasian whence i argue that he be a mexican a supposition that late inquiry confirm. they be a picturesque set of fiend and polite be too absorb in their game to look at the strange. we be all deep down under the earth and save for the rustle of a blue gown sleeve and the ghostly whisper of the card a they be shuffle and play there be no sound. the heat be almost unendurable. there be some dispute between the mexican and the man on his leave. the latter shift his place to put the table between himself and his opponent and stretch a lean yellow hand towards the mexican s winning. 
mark how purely man be a creature of instinct. rarely introduce to the pistol i saw the mexican half rise in his chair and at the same instant find myself full length on the floor. none have tell me that this be the best attitude when bullet be abroad. i be there prone before i have time to think drop a the room be fill with an intolerable clamour like the discharge of a cannon. in those close quarter the pistol report have no room to spread any more than the smoke then acrid in my nostril. there be no second shoot but a great silence in which i rise slowly to my knee. the chinaman be grip the table with both hand and star in front of him at an empty chair. the mexican have go and a little whirl of smoke be float near the roof. still grip the table the chinaman say. ah. in the tone that a man would use when look up from his work suddenly he see a well know friend in the doorway. then he cough and fell over to his own right and i saw that he have be shoot in the stomach. 
i become aware that save for two men lean over the stricken one the room be empty. and all the tide of intense fear hitherto hold back by intense curiosity sweep over my soul. i ardently desire the outside air. it be possible that the chinaman would mistake me for the mexican everything horrible seem possible just then and it be more than possible that the stairway would be close while they be hunt for the murderer. the man on the floor cough a sicken cough. i hear it a i flee and one of his companion turn out the lamp. those stair seem interminable and to add to my dismay there be no sound of commotion in the house. no one hinder no one even look at me. there be no trace of the mexican. i find the doorway and my leg tremble under me reach the protection of the clear cool night the fog and the rain. i dare not run and for the life of me i could not walk. i must have effect a compromise for i remember the light of a street lamp show the shadow of one half skip caracole along the pavement in what seem to be an ecstacy of suppress happiness. but it be fear deadly fear. fear compound of past knowledge of the oriental only other white man available witness three story underground and the cough of the chinaman now some forty foot under my clatter boot heel. it be good to see the shop front and electric light again. not for anything would i have inform the police because i firmly believe that the mexican have be deal with somewhere down there on the third floor long ere i have reach the air. and moreover once clear of the place i could not for the life of me tell where it be. my ill consider flight bring me out somewhere a mile distant from the hotel. and the clank of the lift that bore me to a bed six story above grind be music in my ear. wherefore i would impress it upon you who follow after do not knock about the chinese quarter at night and alone. you may stumble across a picturesque piece of human nature that will unsteady your nerve for half a day. 
* * * * *. 
and this bring me by natural sequence to the great drink question. a you know of course the american doe not drink at meal a a sensible man should. indeed he ha no meal. he stuff for ten minute thrice a day. also he ha no decent notion about the sun be over the yard arm or below the horizon. he pour his vanity into himself at unholy hour and indeed he can hardly help it. you have no notion of what treat mean on the western slope. it be more than an institution. it be a religion though men tell me that it be nothing to what it be. take a very common instance. at. a. m. a man be smite with desire for stimulant. he be in the company of two friend. all three adjourn to the near bar seldom more than twenty yard away and take three straight whisky. they talk for two minute. the second and third man then treat in order. and thus each walk into the street two of them the poor by three go of whisky under their belt and one with two more liquor than he want. it be not etiquette yet to refuse a treat. the result be peculiar. i have never yet i confess see a drunken man in the street but i have hear more about drunkenness among white men and see more decent men above or below themselves with drink than i care to think about. and the vice run up into all sort of circle and society. never be i more astonish than at one pleasant dinner party to hear a pair of pretty lip say casually of a gentleman friend then under discussion he be drink. the fact be merely state without emotion. that be what startle me. but the climate of california deal kindly with excess and treacherously cover up it trace. a man neither bloat nor shrivel in this dry air. he continue with the false bloom of health upon his cheek an equable eye a firm mouth and a steady hand till a day of reckon arrive and suddenly break up about the head he dy and his friend speak his epitaph accordingly. why people who in most case cannot hold their liquor should play with it so recklessly i leave to others to decide. this unhappy state of affair ha however produce one good result which i will confide to you. in the heart of the business quarter where bank and banker be thick and telegraph wire most numerous stand a semi subterranean bar tend by a german with long blond lock and a crystalline eye. go thither softly tread on the tip of your toe and ask him for a button punch. twill take ten minute to brew but the result be the high and noble product of the age. no man but one know what be in it. i have a theory it be compound of the shaving of cherub wing the glory of a tropical dawn the red cloud of sunset and fragment of lose epic by dead master. but try you for yourselves and pause a while to bless me who be always mindful of the true interest of my brother. 
but enough of the stale spilth of bar room. turn now to the august spectacle of a government of the people by the people for the people a it be understand in the city of san francisco. professor bryce s book will tell you that every american citizen over twenty one year of age posse a vote. he may not know how to run his own business control his wife or instil reverence into his child may be pauper half craze with drink bankrupt dissolute or merely a bear fool. but he ha a vote. if he like he can be vote most of his time vote for his state governor his municipal officer local option sewage contract or anything else of which he ha no special knowledge. 
once every four year he vote for a new president. in his spare moment he vote for his own judge the men who shall give him justice. these be dependent on popular favour for re election inasmuch a they be but choose for a term of year two or three i believe. such a position be manifestly best calculate to create an independent and unprejudiced administrator. now this mass of person who vote be divide into two party republican and democrat. they be both agree in think that the other part be run creation. which be america. into red flame. also the democrat a a party drink more than the republican and when drink may be hear to talk about a thing call the tariff which he doe not understand but which he conceive to be the bulwark of the country or else the sure power for it destruction. sometimes he say one thing and sometimes another in order to contradict the republican who be always contradict himself. and this be a true and lucid account of the forepart of american politics. the behind part be otherwise. 
since every man ha a vote and may vote on every conceivable thing it follow that there exist certain wise men who understand the art of buy up vote retail and vend them wholesale to whoever want them most urgently. now an american engage in make a home for himself ha not time to vote for turn cock and district attorney and cattle of that kind but the unemployed have much time because they be always on hand somewhere in the street. they be call the boy and form a peculiar class. the boy be young men. inexpert in war unskilled in labour. who have neither kill a man lift cattle or dig a well. in plain english they be just the men in the street who can always be trust to rally round any cause that ha a glass of liquor for a visible heart. they wait they be on hand. and in be on hand lie the crown and the glory of american politics. the wise man be he who keep a liquor saloon and judiciously dispense drink know how to retain within arm s reach a block of men who will vote for or against anything under the canopy of heaven. not every saloon keeper can do this. it demand careful study of city politics tact the power of conciliation and infinite resource of anecdote to amuse and keep the crowd together night after night till the saloon become a salon. above all the liquor side of the scheme must not be work for immediate profit. the boy who drink so freely will ultimately pay their host a thousandfold. an irishman and an irishman pre eminently know how to work such a saloon parliament. observe for a moment the plan of operation. the rank and file be treat to drink and a little money and they vote. he who control ten vote receive a proportionate reward. the dispenser of a thousand vote be worthy of reverence and so the chain run on till we reach the most successful worker of public saloon the man most skilful in keep his item together and use them when require. such a man govern the city a absolutely a a king. and you would know where the gain come in. the whole of the public office of a city. with the exception of a very few where special technical skill be require. be short term office distribute accord to political leaning. what would you have. a big city require many official. each office carry a salary and influence worth twice the pay. the office be for the representative of the men who keep together and be on hand to vote. the commissioner of sewage let u say be a gentleman who ha be elect to his office by a republican vote. he know little and care le about sewage but he ha sense enough to man the pump work and the street sweep machine with the gentleman who elect him. the commissioner of police ha be help to his post very largely by the influence of the boy at such and such a saloon. he may be the guardian of city moral but he be not go to allow his subordinate to enforce early close or abstention from gamble in that saloon. most office be limit to four year consequently he be a fool who doe not make his office pay him while he be in it. 
the only people who suffer by this happy arrangement be in fact the people who devise the lovely system. and they suffer because they be american. let u explain. a you know every big city here hold at least one big foreign vote generally irish frequently german. in san francisco the gather place of the race there be a distinct italian vote to be consider but the irish vote be more important. for this reason the irishman doe not kill himself with overwork. he be make for the cheery dispense of liquor for everlasting blarney and posse a wonderfully keen appreciation of the weakness of less human nature. also he ha no sort of conscience and only one strong conviction that of deep root hatred toward england. he keep to the street he be on hand he vote joyously spend day lavishly and time be the american s dear commodity. behold the glorious result. to day the city of san francisco be govern by the irish vote and the irish influence under the rule of a gentleman whose sight be impair and who require a man to lead him about the street. he be call officially bos buckley and unofficially the blind white devil. i have before me now the record of his amiable career in black and white. it occupy four column of small print and perhaps you would think it disgraceful. summarise it be a follow. bos buckley by tact and deep knowledge of the seamy side of the city win himself a follow of voter. he seek no office himself or rarely. but a his follow increase he sell their service to the high bidder himself take toll of the revenue of every office. he control the democratic party in the city of san francisco. the people appoint their own judge. bos buckley s people appoint judge. these judge naturally be bos buckley s property. i have be to dinner party and hear educate men not concern with politics tell story one to another of justice both civil and criminal be buy with a price from the hand of these judge. such tale they tell without heat a men record fact. contract for road mend public building and the like be under the control of bos buckley because the men whom buckley s follow send to the city council adjudicate on these contract. and on each and every one of these contract bos buckley levy his percentage for himself and his ally. 
the republican party in san francisco also have their bos. he be not so great a genius a bos buckley but i decline to believe that he be any whit more virtuous. he ha a small number of vote at his command.

i have be watch machinery in repose after read about machinery in action. an excellent gentleman who bear a name honour in the magazine write much a disraeli orate of the sublime instinct of an ancient people the certainty with which they can be trust to manage their own affair in their own way and the speed with which they be make for all sort of desirable goal. this he call a statement or purview of american politics. i go almost directly afterwards to a saloon where gentleman interest in ward politics nightly congregate. they be not pretty person. some of them be bloat and they all swear cheerfully till the heavy gold watch chain on their fat stomach rise and fell again. but they talk over their liquor a men who have power and unquestioned access to place of trust and profit. the magazine writer discuss theory of government. these men the practice. they have be there. they know all about it. they bang their fist on the table and speak of political pull the vend of vote and so forth. theirs be not the talk of village babbler reconstruct the affair of the nation but of strong coarse lustful men fight for spoil and thoroughly understand the best method of reach it. i listen long and intently to speech i could not understand or only in spot. it be the speech of business however. i have sense enough to know that_ and to do my laugh outside the door. then i begin to understand why my pleasant and well educate host in san francisco speak with a bitter scorn of such duty of citizenship a vote and take an interest in the distribution of office. score of men have tell me with no false pride that they would a soon concern themselves with the public affair of the city or state a rake muck. read about politics a the culture writer of the magazine regard em and then and not till then_ pay your respect to the gentleman who run the grimy reality. 
i m sick of interview night editor who in response to my demand for the record of a prominent citizen answer. well you see he begin by keep a saloon etc. i prefer to believe that my informant be treat me a in the old sinful day in india i be use to treat our wander globe trotter. they declare that they speak the truth and the news of dog politics lately vouchsafe to me in groggeries incline me to believe but i win t. the people be much too nice to slangander a recklessly a i have be do. besides i be hopelessly in love with about eight american maiden all perfectly delightful till the next one come into the room. o toyo be a darling but she lack several thing. conversation for one. you cannot live on giggle. she shall remain unmoved at nagasaki while i roast a batter heart before the shrine of a big kentucky blonde who have for a nurse when she be little a negro mammy. by consequence she ha weld on to californian beauty paris dress eastern culture europe trip and wild western originality the queer dreamy superstition of the negro quarter and the result be soul shatter. and she be but one of many star. item_ a maiden who belief in education and posse it with a few hundred thousand dollar to boot and a taste for slum. item_ the leader of a sort of informal salon where girl congregate read paper and daringly discus metaphysical problem and candy a sloe eye black browed imperious maiden. item_ a very small maiden absolutely without reverence who can in one swift sentence trample upon and leave gasp half a dozen young men. item_ a millionnairess burden with her money lonely caustic with a tongue keen a a sword yearn for a sphere but chain up to the rock of her vast possession. item_ a typewriter maiden earn her own bread in this big city because she doesn t think a girl ought to be a burden on her parent. she quote th√©ophile gautier and move through the world manfully much respect for all her twenty inexperienced summer. item_ a woman from cloudland who ha no history in the past but be discreetly of the present and strive for the confidence of male humanity on the ground of sympathy. this be not altogether a new type. item_ a girl in a dive bless with a greek head and eye that seem to speak all that be best and sweet in the world. but woe be me. she ha no idea in this world or the next beyond the consumption of beer. a commission on each bottle. and protest that she sing the song allot to her nightly with no more than the vague notion of their mean. 
sweet and comely be the maiden of devonshire. delicate and of gracious seem those who live in the pleasant place of london. fascinate for all their demureness the damsel of france cling closely to their mother and with large eye wonder at the wicked world. excellent in her own place and to those who understand her be the anglo indian spin in her second season. but the girl of america be above and beyond them all. they be clever. they can talk. yea it be say that they think. certainly they have an appearance of so do. they be original and look you between the brow with unabashed eye a a sister might look at her brother. they be instruct in the folly and vanity of the male mind for they have associate with the boy from babyhood and can discerningly minister to both vice or pleasantly snub the possessor. they posse moreover a life among themselves independent of masculine association. they have society and club and unlimited tea fight where all the guest be girl. they be self possess without part with any tenderness that be their sex right. they understand. they can take care of themselves. they be superbly independent. when you ask them what make them so charm they say. it be because we be good educate than your girl and and we be more sensible in regard to men. we have good time all round but we aren t teach to regard every man a a possible husband. nor be he expect to marry the first girl he call on regularly. yes they have good time their freedom be large and they do not abuse it. they can go drive with young men and receive visit from young men to an extent that would make an english mother wink with horror. and neither driver nor drivee have a think beyond the enjoyment of a good time. a certain also of their own poet have say. 
man be fire and woman be tow and the devil he come and begin to blow. 
in america the tow be soak in a solution that make it fire proof in absolute liberty and large knowledge. consequently accident do not exceed the regular percentage arrange by the devil for each class and climate under the sky. but the freedom of the young girl ha it drawback. she be i say it with all reluctance irreverent from her forty dollar bonnet to the buckle in her eighteen dollar shoe. she talk flippantly to her parent and men old enough to be her grandfather. she ha a prescriptive right to the society of the man who arrive. the parent admit it. this be sometimes embarrass especially when you call on a man and his wife for the sake of information. the one be a merchant of vary knowledge the other a woman of the world. in five minute your host ha vanish. in another five his wife ha follow him and you be leave with a very charm maiden doubtless but certainly not the person you come to see. she chatter and you grin. but you leave with the very strong impression of a waste morning. this ha be my experience once or twice. i have even say a pointedly a i dare to a man. i come to see you. you d good see me in my office then. the house belong to my woman folk to my daughter that be to say. he speak with truth. the american of wealth be own by his family. they exploit him for bullion and sometimes it seem to me that his lot be a lonely one. the woman get the ha penny. the kick be all his own. nothing be too good for an american s daughter. i speak here of the moneyed class. the girl take every gift a a matter of course. yet they develop greatly when a catastrophe arrive and the man of many million go up or go down and his daughter take to stenography or type write. i have hear many tale of heroism from the lip of girl who count the principal among their friend. the crash come. mamie or hattie or sadie give up their maid their carriage and candy and with a no. remington and a stout heart set about earn their daily bread. 
and do i drop her from the list of my friend. no sir say a scarlet lipped vision in white lace. that might happen to me any day. 
it may be this sense of possible disaster in the air that make san franciscan society go with so captivate a rush and whirl. recklessness be in the air. i can t explain where it come from but there it be. the roar wind off the pacific make you drink to begin with. the aggressive luxury on all side help out the intoxication and you spin for ever down the ring grove of change. there be no small change by the way west of the rockies. a long a money last. they make greatly and they spend lavishly. not only the rich but the artisan who pay nearly five pound for a suit of clothe and for other luxury in proportion. the young men rejoice in the day of their youth. they gamble yacht race enjoy prize fight and cock fight the one openly the other in secret they establish luxurious club. they break themselves over horse flesh and other thing. and they be instant in quarrel. at twenty they be experience in business. embark in vast enterprise take partner a experience a themselves and go to piece with a much splendour a their neighbour. remember that the men who stock california in the fifty be physically and a far a regard certain tough virtue the pick of the earth. the inept and the weakly die en route or go under in the day of construction. to this nucleus be add all the race of the continent french italian german and of course the jew. the result you shall see in large bone deep chested delicate hand woman and long elastic well build boy. it need no little golden badge swing from his watch chain to mark the native son of the golden west the country breed of california. him i love because he be devoid of fear carry himself like a man and ha a heart a big a his boot. i fancy too he know how to enjoy the blessing of life that his world so abundantly bestow upon him. at least i hear a little rat of a creature with hock bottle shoulder explain that a man from chicago could pull the eye teeth of a californian in business. well if i live in fairyland where cherry be a big a plum plum a big a apple and strawberry of no account. where the procession of the fruit of the season be like a pageant in a drury lane pantomime and where the dry air be wine i should let business slide once in a way and kick up my heel with my fellow. the tale of the resource of california vegetable and mineral be a fairy tale. you can read it in book. you would never believe me. all manner of nourish food from sea fish to beef may be buy at the low price. and the people be well develop and of a high stomach. they demand ten shilling for tinker a jam lock of a trunk. they receive sixteen shilling a day for work a carpenter. they spend many sixpence on very bad cigar and they go mad over a prize fight. when they disagree they do so fatally with firearm in their hand and on the public street. i be just clear of mission street when the trouble begin between two gentleman one of whom perforate the other. when a policeman whose name i do not recollect fatally shoot ed. kearney for attempt to escape arrest i be in the next street. for these thing i be thankful. it be enough to travel with a policeman in a tram car and while he arrange his coat tail a he sit down to catch sight of a load revolver. it be enough to know that fifty per cent of the men in the public saloon carry pistol about them. the chinaman waylay his adversary and methodically chop him to piece with his hatchet. then the press roar about the brutal ferocity of the pagan. the italian reconstruct his friend with a long knife. the press complain of the waywardness of the alien. the irishman and the native californian in their hour of discontent use the revolver not once but six time. the press record the fact and ask in the next column whether the world can parallel the progress of san francisco. the american who love this country will tell you that this sort of thing be confine to the low class. just at present an ex judge who be send to jail by another judge. upon my word i cannot tell whether these title mean anything. be breathe red hot vengeance against his enemy. the paper have interview both party and confidently expect a fatal issue. 
now let me draw breath and curse the negro waiter and through him the negro in service generally. he ha be make a citizen with a vote. consequently both political party play with him. but that be neither here nor there. he will commit in one meal every b√©tise that a scullion fresh from the plough tail be capable of and he will continue to repeat those fault. he be a complete a heavy foot uncomprehending bungle fisted fool a any memsahib in the east ever take into her establishment. but he be accord to law a free and independent citizen consequently above reproof or criticism. he and he alone in this insane city will wait at table. the chinaman doesn t count. he be untrained inept but he will fill the place and draw the pay. now god and his father s kismet make him intellectually inferior to the oriental. he insist on pretend that he serf table by accident a a sort of amusement. he wish you to understand this little fact. you wish to eat your meal and if possible to have them properly serve. he be a big black vain baby and a man roll into one. a colour gentleman who insist on get me pie when i want something else demand information about india. i give him some fact about wage. oh hell say he cheerfully that wouldn t keep me in cigar for a month. then he fawn on me for a ten cent piece. late he take it upon himself to pity the native of india heathen he call them this woolly one whose race ha be the butt of every comedy on the asiatic stage since the begin. and i turn and saw by the head upon his shoulder that he be a yoruba man if there be any truth in ethnological caste. he do his think in english but he be a yoruba negro and the race type have remain the same throughout his generation. and the room be full of other race some that look exactly like gallas. but the trade be never recruit from that side of africa. some duplicate of cameroon head and some kroomen if ever kroomen wear even dress. the american doe not consider little matter of descent though by this time he ought to know all about damnable heredity. a a general rule he keep himself very far from the negro and say unpretty thing about him. there be six million negro more or le in the state and they be increase. the american once have make them citizen cannot unmake them. he say in his newspaper they ought to be elevate by education. he be try this. but it be like to be a long job because black blood be much more adhesive than white and throw back with annoy persistence. when the negro get a religion he return directly a a hive bee to the first instinct of his people. just now a wave of religion be sweep over some of the southern state. up to the present two messiah and one daniel have appear. and several human sacrifice have be offer up to these incarnation. the daniel manage to get three young men who he insist be shadrach meshach and abednego to walk into a blast furnace. guarantee non combustion. they do not return. i have see nothing of this kind but i have attend a negro church. the congregation be move by the spirit to groan and tear and one of them dance up the aisle to the mourner bench. the motive may have be genuine. the movement of the shake body be those of a zanzibar stick dance such a you see at aden on the coal boat. and even a i watch the people the link that bind them to the white man snap one by one and i saw before me the hubshi. the woolly one. pray to the god he do not understand. those neatly dress folk on the bench the grey head elder by the window be savage neither more nor le. what will the american do with the negro. the south will not consort with him. in some state miscegenation be a penal offence. the north be every year le and le in need of his service. and he will not disappear. he will continue a a problem. his friend will urge that he be a good a the white man. his enemy. it be not good to be a negro in the land of the free and the home of the brave. 
but this ha nothing to do with san francisco and her merry maiden her strong swagger men and her wealth of gold and pride. they bore me to a banquet in honour of a brave lieutenant carlin of the vandalia who stick by his ship in the great cyclone at apia and comport himself a an officer should. on that occasion twas at the bohemian club i hear oratory with the round of o s. and devour a dinner the memory of which will descend with me into the hungry grave. there be about forty speech deliver. and not one of them be average or ordinary. it be my first introduction to the american eagle scream for all it be worth. the lieutenant s heroism serve a a peg from which those silver tongue one turn themselves loose and kick. they ransack the cloud of sunset the thunderbolt of heaven the deep of hell and the splendour of the resurrection for trope and metaphor and hurl the result at the head of the guest of the even. never since the morning star sing together for joy i learn have an amaze creation witness such superhuman bravery a that display by the american navy in the samoa cyclone. till earth rot in the phosphorescent star and stripe slime of a decay universe that god like gallantry would not be forget. i grieve that i cannot give the exact word. my attempt at reproduce their spirit be pale and inadequate. i sit bewilder on a coruscate niagara of blatherumskite. it be magnificent it be stupendous. and i be conscious of a wicked desire to hide my face in a napkin and grin. then accord to rule they produce their dead and across the snowy tablecloth drag the corpse of every man slay in the civil war and hurl defiance at our natural enemy. england so please you. with her chain of fortress across the world. thereafter they glorify their nation afresh from the begin in case any detail should have be overlook and that make me uncomfortable for their sake. how in the world can a white man a sahib of our blood stand up and plaster praise on his own country. he can think a highly a he like but his open mouth vehemence of adoration strike me almost a indelicate. my host talk for rather more than three hour and at the end seem ready for three hour more. but when the lieutenant such a big brave gentle giant. rise to his foot he deliver what seem to me a the speech of the even. i remember nearly the whole of it and it run something in this way. gentleman it s very good of you to give me this dinner and to tell me all these pretty thing but what i want you to understand the fact be what we want and what we ought to get at once be a navy more ship lot of em then we howl the top of the roof off and i for one fell in love with carlin on the spot. wallah. he be a man. 
the prince among merchant bid me take no heed to the warlike sentiment of some of the old general. the sky rocket be throw in for effect quoth he and whenever we get on our hind leg we always express a desire to chaw up england. it s a sort of family affair. 
and indeed when you come to think of it there be no other country for the american public speaker to trample upon. 
france ha germany. we have russia. for italy austria be provide. and the humble pathan posse an ancestral enemy. only america stand out of the racket. and therefore to be in fashion make a sand bag of the mother country and bang her when occasion require. the chain of fortress man a fascinate talker explain to me after the affair that he be compel to blow off steam. everybody expect it. when we have chant the star spangle banner not more than eight time we adjourn. america be a very great country but it be not yet heaven with electric light and plush fitting a the speaker profess to believe. my listen mind go back to the politician in the saloon who waste no time in talk about freedom but quietly make arrangement to impose their will on the citizen. the judge be a great man but give thy present to the clerk a the proverb saith. 
and what more remain to tell. i cannot write connectedly because i be in love with all those girl aforesaid and some others who do not appear in the invoice. the type writer girl be an institution of which the comic paper make much capital but she be vastly convenient. she and a companion rent a room in a business quarter and copy manuscript at the rate of six anna a page. only a woman can manage a type write machine because she ha serve apprenticeship to the sew machine. she can earn a much a a hundred dollar a month and profess to regard this form of bread win a her natural destiny. but oh how she hate it in her heart of heart. when i have get over the surprise of do business and try to give order to a young woman of coldly clerkly aspect intrench behind gold rim spectacle i make inquiry concern the pleasure of this independence. they like it indeed they do. twas the natural fate of almost all girl the recognise custom in america and i be a barbarian not to see it in that light. 
well and after. say i. what happen. 
we work for our bread. 
and then what do you expect. 
then we shall work for our bread. 
till you die. 
ye e unless. 
unless what. a man work till he dy. 
so shall we. this without enthusiasm i suppose. 
say the partner in the firm audaciously. sometimes we marry our employer at least that s what the newspaper say. the hand bang on half a dozen of the key of the machine at once. yes i don t care. i hate it i hate it i hate it and you needn t look so. 
the senior partner be regard the rebel with grave eye reproach. 
i think you do say i. i don t suppose american girl be much different from english one in instinct. 
isn t it th√©ophile gautier who say that the only difference between country and country lie in the slang and the uniform of the police. 
now in the name of all the god at once what be one to say to a young lady. who in england would be a person. who earn her own bread and very naturally hate the employ and sling out of the way quotation at your head. that one fall in love with her go without say. but that be not enough. 
a mission should be establish. 
no. xxvi. 
take me through bret harte s country and to portland with old man california. explain how two vagabond become homesick through look at other people s house. 
i walk in the lonesome even and who so sad a i a i saw the young men and maiden merrily pass by. 
san francisco ha only one drawback. ti hard to leave. when like the pious han breitmann i cut that city by the sea it be with regret for the pleasant place leave behind for the men who be so clever and the woman who be so witty for the dive the beer hall the bucket shop and the poker hell where humanity be go to the devil with shout and laughter and song and the rattle of dice box. i would fain have stay but i fear that an evil end would come to me when my money be all spend and i descend to the street corner. a voice inside me say. get out of this. go north. strike for victoria and vancouver. bask for a day under the shadow of the old flag. so i set forth from san francisco to portland in oregon and that be a railroad run of thirty six hour. 
the oakland railway terminus whence all the main line start doe not own anything approach to a platform. a yard with a dozen or more track be roughly asphalt and the traveller lade with hand bag skip merrily across the metal in search of his own particular train. the bell of half a dozen shunt engine be toll suggestively in his ear. if he be run down so much the bad for him. when the bell ring look out for the locomotive. long use ha make the nation familiar and even contemptuous towards train to an extent which god never intend. woman who in england would gather up their skirt and scud timorously over a level cross in the country here talk dress and baby under the very nose of the cow catcher and little child dally with the move car in a manner horrible to behold. we pull out at the wholly insignificant speed of twenty five mile an hour through the street of a suburb of fifty thousand and in our progress among the cart and the child and the shop front slew nobody. at which i be not a little disappoint. 
when the negro porter bed me up for the night and i have solve the problem of undress while lie down i be much cheer by the think that if anything happen i should have to stay where i be and wait till the kerosene lamp set the overturn car alight and burn me to death. it be easy to get out of a full theatre than to leave a pullman in haste. 
by the time i have discover that a profusion of nickel plat plush and damask doe not compensate for closeness and dust the train run into the daylight on the bank of the sacramento river. a few window be gingerly open after the bunk have be reconvert into seat but that long coffin car be by no mean ventilate and we be a gummy grimy crew who sit there. at six in the morning the heat be distinctly unpleasant but see with the eye of the flesh that i be in bret harte s own country i rejoice. there be the pine and madrone clothe hill his miner live and fight among. there be the heat red earth that show whence the gold have be wash. the dry gulch the red dusty road where hamblin be use to stop the stage in the interval of his elegant leisure and superior card play. there be the timber fell and sweat resin in the sunshine. and above all there be the quiver pungent heat that bret harte drive into your dull brain with the magic of his pen. when we stop at a collection of pack case dignify by the name of a town my felicity be complete. the name of the place be something offensive amberville or jacksonburgh but it own a cast iron fountain worthy of a town of thirty thousand. next to the fountain be a hotel at least seventeen foot high include the chimney and next to the hotel be the forest the pine the oak and the untrammelled undergrowth of the hillside. a cinnamon bear cub baby sylvester in the very fur be tie to the stump of a tree opposite the fountain. a pack mule doze in the dust haze a red shirt miner in a slouch hat support the hotel a blue shirt miner swing round the corner and the two go indoors for a drink. a girl come out of the only other house but one and shade her eye with a brown hand star at the pant train. she didn t recognise me but i know her have know her for year. she be m li. she never marry the schoolmaster after all but stay always young and always fair among the pine. i know red shirt too. he be one of the beard men who stand back when tennessee claim his partner from the hand of the law. the sacramento river a few yard away shout that all these thing be true. the train go on while baby sylvester stand on his downy head and m li swing her sun bonnet by the string. 
what do you think. say a lawyer who be travel with me. it s a new world to you. isn t it. 
no. it s quite familiar. i be never out of england. it s a if i saw it all. 
quick a light come the answer. yes they live once thus at venice when the miner be the king. 
i love that lawyer on the spot. we drink to bret harte who you remember claim california but california never claim him. he s turn english. 
lie back in state i wait for the fly mile to turn over the page of the book i know. they bring me all i desire from the man of no account sit on a stump and play with a dog to that most sarcastic man the quiet mister brown. he board the train from out of the wood and there be venom and sulphur on his tongue. he have just lose a lawsuit. only yuba bill fail to appear. the train have take his employment from him. a nameless ruffian back me into a corner and begin tell me about the resource of the country and what it would eventually become. all i remember of his lecture be that you could catch trout in the sacramento river the stream that we follow so faithfully. 
then rise a tough and wiry old man with grizzle hair and make inquiry about the trout. to him be add the secretary of a life insurance company. i fancy he be travel to rake in the dead that the train kill. but he too be a fisherman and the two turn to meward. the frankness of a western be delightful. they tell me that in the eastern state i shall meet another type of man and a more reserve. the californian always speak of the man from the new england state a a different breed. it be our punjab and madras over again but more so. the old man be on a holiday in search of fish. when he discover a brother loafer he propose a confederation of rod. quoth the insurance agent i m not stay any time in portland but i will introduce you to a man there who ll tell you about fish. the two tell strange tale a we slide through the forest and saw afar off the snowy head of a great mountain. there be vineyard fruit orchard and wheat field where the land open out and every ten mile or so twenty or thirty wooden house and at least three church. a large town would have a population of two thousand and an infinite belief in it own capacity. sometimes a flare advertisement flank the line call for men to settle down take up the grind and make their home there. at a big town we could pick up the local newspaper narrow a the cut edge of a chisel and twice a keen a journal fill with the price of stock notice of improve reap and bind machine movement of eminent citizen whose fame beyond their own abide extend for mile along the harlem road. there be not much grace about these paper but all breathe the same need for good men steady men who would plough and till and build school for their child and make a township in the hill. once only i find a sharp change in the note and a very pathetic one. i think it be a young soul in trouble who be write poetry. the editor have jam the verse between the flamboyant advertisement of a real estate agent a man who sell you land and lie about it and that of a jew tailor who dispose of nobby suit at cut throat price. here be two verse. i think they tell their own story. 
god make the pine with it root in the earth it top in the sky. they have burn the pine to increase the worth of the wheat and the silver rye. 
go weigh the cost of the soul of the pine cut off from the sky. and the price of the wheat that grow so fine and the worth of the silver rye. 
the thin lipped keen eye men who board the train would not read that poetry or if they do would not understand. heaven guard that poor pine in the desert and keep it top in the sky. 
when the train take to itself an extra engine and begin to breathe heavily some one say that we be ascend the siskiyou mountain. we have be climb steadily from san francisco and at last win to over four thousand foot above sea level always run through forest. then naturally enough we come down but we drop two thousand two hundred foot in about thirteen mile. it be not so much the grind of the brake along the train or the sight of three curve of track apparently mile below u or even the vision of a good train apparently just under our wheel or even the tunnel that make me reflect. it be the trestle over which we crawl trestle something over a hundred foot high and look like a collection of match stick. 
i guess our timber be a much a curse a a bless say the old man from southern california. these trestle last very well for five or six year. then they get out of repair and a train go through em or else a forest fire burn em up. 
this be say in the middle of a groan shiver trestle. an occasional plate layer take a look at u a we go down but that railway didn t waste men on inspection duty. very often there be cattle on the track against which the engine use a diabolical form of whistle. the old man have be a driver in his youth and beguile the way with cheery anecdote of what might be expect if we foul a young calf. 
you see they get their leg under the cow catcher and that ll put an engine off the line. i remember when a hog wreck an excursion train and kill sixty people. guess the engineer will look out though. 
there be considerably too much guess about this large nation. a one of them put it rather forcibly. we guess a trestle will stand for ever and we guess that we can patch up a washout on the track and we guess the road s clear and sometimes we guess ourselves into the deepot_ and sometimes we guess ourselves into hell. 
* * * * *. 
the descent bring u far into oregon and a timber and wheat country. we drive through wheat and pine in alternate slice but pine chiefly till we reach portland which be a city of fifty thousand possess the electric light of course equally of course devoid of pavement and a port of entry about a hundred mile from the sea at which big steamer can load. it be a poor city that cannot say it ha no equal on the pacific coast. portland shout this to the pine which run down from a thousand foot ridge clear up to the city. you may sit in a bedizen bar room furnish with telephone and clicker and in half an hour be in the wood. 
portland produce lumber and jig saw fitting for house and beer and buggy and brick and biscuit. and in case you should miss the fact there be glorify view of the town hang up in public place with the value of the product set down in dollar. all this be excellent and exactly suitable to the open of a new country. but when a man tell you it be civilisation you object. the first thing that the civilise man learn to do be to keep the dollar in the background because they be only the oil of the machine that make life go smoothly. 
portland be so busy that it can t attend to it own sewage or pave and the four storey brick block front cobble stone and plank sidewalk and other thing much bad. i saw a foundation be dig out. the sewage of perhaps twenty year ago have thoroughly soak into the soil and there be a familiar and oriental look about the compost that fly up with each shovel load. yet the local paper a be just and proper swear there be no place like portland oregon u. s. a. chronicle the performance of oregonian claim prominent citizen elsewhere a oregonian and fight tooth and nail for dock rail and wharfage project. and you could find men who have throw in their life with the city who be bind up in it and work their life out for what they conceive to be it material prosperity. pity it be to record that in this strenuous labour town there have be a week before a shoot case. one well know man have shoot another on the street and be now plead self defence because the other man have or the murderer think he have a pistol about him. not content with shoot him dead he squibbed off his revolver into him a he lay. i read the pleading and they make me ill. so far a i could judge if the dead man s body have be find with a pistol on it the shooter would have go free. apart from the mere murder cowardly enough in itself there be a refinement of cowardice in the plea. here in this civilise city the survive brute be afraid he would be shoot fancy he saw the other man make a motion to his hip pocket and so on. eventually the jury disagree. and the degrade thing be that the trial be report by men who evidently understand all about the pistol be try before a jury who be verse in the etiquette of the hip pocket and be discuss on the street by men equally initiate. 
but let u return to more cheerful thing. the insurance agent introduce u a friend to a real estate man who promptly bid u go up the columbia river for a day while he make inquiry about fish. there be no overwhelm formality. the old man be address a california i answer indifferently to england or johnny bull and the real estate man be portland. this be a lofty and spacious form of address. 
so california and i take a steamboat and upon a sumptuous blue and gold morning steer up the willamette river on which portland stand into the great columbia the river that bring the salmon that go into the tin that be empty into the dish when the extra guest arrive in india. california introduce me to the boat and the scenery show me the texas the difference between a tow head and a sawyer and the precise nature of a slue. all i remember be a delightful feel that mark twain s huckleberry finn and mississippi pilot be quite true and that i could almost recognise the very reach down which huck and jim have drift. we be on the border line between oregon state and washington territory but that didn t matter. the columbia be the mississippi so far a i be concern. we run along the side of wooded island whose bank be cave in with perpetual smash and we skip from one side to another of the mile wide stream in search of a channel exactly like a mississippi steamer and when we want to pick up or set down a passenger we choose a soft and safe place on the shore and run our very snub nose against it. california speak to each new passenger a he come aboard and tell me the man s birthplace. a long haired tender of kine crash out of the underwood wave his hat and be take aboard forthwith. south carolina say california almost without look at him. when he talk you will hear a soft dialect than mine. and it befall a he say. whereat i marvel and california chuckle. every island in the river carry field of rich wheat orchard and a white wooden house. or else if the pine grow very thickly a sawmill the tremulous whine of whose saw flicker across the water like the drone of a tire bee. from remark he let fall i gather that california own timber ship and deal in lumber have ranch too a partner and everything handsome about him. in addition to a chequer career of some thirty five year. but he look almost a disreputable a loafer a i. 
say young feller we re go to see scenery now. you shout and sing say california when the bland wooded island give place to bold outline and the steamer run herself into a hornet s nest of black fanged rock not a foot below the boil break water. we be try to get up a slue or back channel by a short cut and the stern wheel never spin twice in the same direction. then we hit a float log with a jar that run through our system and then white belly open gilled spin by a dead salmon a lordly twenty pound chinook salmon who have perish in his pride. you ll see the salmon wheel fore long say a man who live way back on the washoogle and whose hat be spangle with trout fly. those chinook salmon never rise to the fly. the cannery take them by the wheel. at the next bend we sight a wheel an infernal arrangement of wire gauze compartment work by the current and move out from a barge in shore to scoop up the salmon a he race up the river. california swear long and fluently at the sight and the more fluently when he be tell of the weight of a good night s catch some thousand of pound. think of the black and bloody murder of it. but you out yonder insist in buy tin salmon and the cannery cannot live by let down line. 
about this time california be strike with madness. i find him dance on the fore deck shout isn t she a daisy. isn t she a darling. he have find a waterfall a blow thread of white vapour that break from the crest of a hill a waterfall eight hundred and fifty foot high whose voice be even loud than the voice of the river. bridal veil jerk out the purser. d n that purser and the people who christen her. why didn t they call her mechlin lace fall at fifty dollar a yard while they be at it. say california. and i agree with him. there be many bridal veil fall in this country but few men say lovely than those that come down to the columbia river. then the scenery begin pour forth with the reckless profusion of nature who when she want to be amiable succeed only in be oppressively magnificent. the river be pen between gigantic stone wall crown with the ruin bastion of oriental palace. the stretch of green water widen and be guard by pine clothe hill three thousand foot high. a wicked devil s thumb nail of rock shoot up a hundred foot in midstream. a sand bar of blind white sand give promise of flat country that the next bend deny. for lo. we be run under a triple tier of fortification lava top pine clothe and terrible. behind them the white dome of mount hood run fourteen thousand foot into the blue and at their foot the river thresh among a belt of cottonwood tree. there i sit down and look at california half out of the boat in his anxiety to see both side of the river at once. he have see my note book and it offend him. young feller let her go and you shut your head. it s not you nor anybody like you can put this down. black the novelist he could. he can describe salmon fish he can. and he glare at me a though he expect me to go and do likewise. 
i can t. i know it i say humbly. 
then thank god that you come along this way. 
we reach a little railway on an island which be to convey u to a second steamer because a the purser explain the river be a trifle break. we have a six mile run sit in the sunshine on a dummy wagon whirl just along the edge of the river bluff. sometimes we dive into the fragrant pine wood ablaze with flower. but we generally watch the river now narrow into a turbulent millrace. just where the whole body of water break in riot over a series of cascade the unite state government have choose to build a lock for steamer and the stream be one boil spout mob of water. a log shoot down the race strike on a rock split from end to end and roll over in white foam. i shudder because my toe be not more than sixty foot above the log and i fear that a stray splinter might have find me. but the train run into the river on a sort of float trestle and i be upon another steamer ere i fully understand why. the cascade be not two hundred yard below u and when we cast off to go upstream the rush of the river ere the wheel strike the water drag u a though we have be tow. then the country open out. and california mourn for his lose bluff and crag till we strike a rock wall four hundred foot high crown by the gigantic figure of a man watch u. on a rocky island we saw the white tomb of an old time settler who have make his money in san francisco but have choose to be bury in an indian bury grind. a decay wooden wickyup where the bone of the indian dead be lay almost touch the tomb. the river run into a canal of basaltic rock paint in yellow vermilion and green by indian and by inferior brute adorn with advertisement of bile bean. we have reach the dalles the centre of a great sheep and wool district and the head of navigation. 
when an american arrive at a new town it be his bounden duty to take it in. california swing his coat over his shoulder with the gesture of a man use to long tramp and together at eight in the even we explore the dalles. the sun have not yet set and it would be light for at least another hour. all the inhabitant seem to own a little villa and one church apiece. the young men be out walk with the young maiden the old folk be sit on the front step not the one that lead to the religiously shutter best draw room but the side front step and the husband and wife be tie back pear tree or gather cherry. a scent of hay reach me and in the stillness we could hear the cattle bell a the cow come home across the lava sprinkle field. california swing down the wooden pavement audibly criticise the housewife hollyhock and the more perfect way of pear graft and a the young men and maiden pass give quaint story of his youth. i felt that i know all the people aforetime i be so interest in them and their life. a woman hang over a gate talk to another woman and a i pass i hear her say skirt and again skirt and i ll send you over the pattern. and i know they be talk dress. we stumble upon a young couple say good by in the twilight and when shall i see you again. quoth he. and i understand that to the doubt heart the tiny little town we parade in twenty minute might be a large a all london and a impassable a an arm camp. i give them both my bless because when shall i see you again. be a question that lie very near to heart of all the world. the last garden gate shut with a click that travel far down the street and the light of the comfortable family begin to shine in the confidingly uncurtained window. 
say johnny bull doesn t all this make you feel lonesome. say california. have you get any folk at home. so ve i a wife and five child and i m only on a holiday. 
and i m only on a holiday i say and we go back to the spittoon wood hotel. ala. for the peace and purity of the little town that i have babble about. at the back of a shop and discreetly curtain be a room where the young men who have be talk to the young maiden could play poker and drink and swear and on the shop be dime novel of bloodshed to corrupt the mind of the little boy and prurient servant girl slush yarn to poison the mind of the girl. california only laugh grimly. he say that all these little one house town be pretty much the same all over the state. 
that night i dream i be back in india with no place to sleep in. tramp up and down the station mall and ask everybody when shall i see you again. 
no. xxvii. 
show how i catch salmon in the clackamas. 
the race be not to the swift nor the battle to the strong. but time and chance cometh to all. 
i have live. the american continent may now sink under the sea for i have take the best that it yield and the best be neither dollar love nor real estate. hear now gentleman of the punjab fish club who whip the reach of the tavi and you who painfully import trout to ootacamund and i will tell you how old man california and i go fish and you shall envy. we return from the dalles to portland by the way we have come the steamer stop en route to pick up a night s catch of one of the salmon wheel on the river and to deliver it at a cannery down stream. when the proprietor of the wheel announce that his take be two thousand two hundred and thirty pound weight of fish and not a heavy catch neither i think he lie. but he send the box aboard and i count the salmon by the hundred huge fifty pounder hardly dead score of twenty and thirty pounder and a host of small fish. 
the steamer halt at a rude wooden warehouse build on pile in a lonely reach of the river and send in the fish. i follow them up a scale strew fishy incline that lead to the cannery. the crazy build be quiver with the machinery on it floor and a glitter bank of tin scrap twenty foot high show where the waste be throw after the can have be punch. only chinaman be employ on the work and they look like blood besmear yellow devil a they cross the rift of sunlight that lay upon the floor. when our consignment arrive the rough wooden box break of themselves a they be dump down under a jet of water and the salmon burst out in a stream of quicksilver. a chinaman jerk up a twenty pounder behead and de tail it with two swift stroke of a knife flick out it internal arrangement with a third and cast it into a bloody dye tank. the headless fish leap from under his hand a though they be face a rapid. other chinaman pull them from the vat and thrust them under a thing like a chaff cutter which descend hew them into unseemly red gobbet fit for the can. more chinaman with yellow crook finger jam the stuff into the can which slide down some marvellous machine forthwith solder their own top a they pass. each can be hastily test for flaw and then sink with a hundred companion into a vat of boil water there to be half cook for a few minute. the can bulge slightly after the operation and be therefore slide along by the trolleyful to men with needle and solder iron who vent them and solder the aperture. except for the label the fine columbia salmon be ready for the market. i be impress not so much with the speed of the manufacture a the character of the factory. inside on a floor ninety by forty the most civilise and murderous of machinery. outside three footstep the thick grow pine and the immense solitude of the hill. our steamer only stay twenty minute at that place but i count two hundred and forty finish can make from the catch of the previous night ere i leave the slippery blood stain scale spangle oily floor and the offal smear chinaman. 
we reach portland california and i cry for salmon and the real estate man to whom we have be intrust by portland the insurance man meet u in the street say that fifteen mile away across country we should come upon a place call clackamas where we might perchance find what we desire. and california his coat tail fly in the wind run to a livery stable and charter a wagon and team forthwith. i could push the wagon about with one hand so light be it structure. the team be purely american that be to say almost human in it intelligence and docility. some one say that the road be not good on the way to clackamas and warn u against smash the spring. portland who have watch the preparation finally reckon he d come along too and under heavenly sky we three companion of a day set forth. california carefully lash our rod into the carriage and the bystander overwhelm u with direction a to the sawmill we be to pas the ferry we be to cross and the sign post we be to seek sign from. half a mile from this city of fifty thousand soul we strike. and this must be take literally. a plank road that would have be a disgrace to an irish village. 
then six mile of macadamise road show u that the team could move. a railway run between u and the bank of the willamette and another above u through the mountain. all the land be dot with small township and the road be full of farmer in their town wagon bunch of tow haired boggle eye urchin sit in the hay behind. the men generally look like loafer but their woman be all well dress. brown hussar braid on a tailor make jacket doe not however consort with hay wagon. then we strike into the wood along what california call a _camina reale_ a good road and portland a fair track. it wind in and out among fire blacken stump under pine tree along the corner of log fence through hollow which must be hopeless marsh in the winter and up absurd gradient. but nowhere throughout it length do i see any evidence of road make. there be a track you couldn t well get off it and it be all you could do to stay on it. the dust lay a foot thick in the blind rut and under the dust we find bit of plank and bundle of brushwood that send the wagon bound into the air. sometimes we crash through bracken. anon where the blackberry grow rank we find a lonely little cemetery the wooden rail all awry and the pitiful stumpy headstone nod drunkenly at the soft green mullein. then with oath and the sound of rent underwood a yoke of mighty bull would swing down a skid road haul a forty foot log along a rudely make slide. a valley full of wheat and cherry tree succeed and halt at a house we buy ten pound weight of luscious black cherry for something le than a rupee and get a drink of icy cold water for nothing while the untended team browse sagaciously by the roadside. once we find a wayside camp of horse dealer lounge by a pool ready for a sale or a swap and once two sun tan youngster shoot down a hill on indian pony their full creel bang from the high pommel saddle. they have be fish and be our brother therefore. we shout aloud in chorus to scare a wild cat. we squabble over the reason that have lead a snake to cross a road. we heave bit of bark at a venturesome chipmunk who be really the little grey squirrel of india and have come to call on me. we lose our way and get the wagon so beautifully fix on a steep road that we have to tie the two hind wheel to get it down. above all california tell tale of nevada and arizona of lonely night spend out prospect of the slaughter of deer and the chase of men. of woman lovely woman who be a firebrand in a western city and lead to the pop of pistol and of the sudden change and chance of fortune who delight in make the miner or the lumberman a quadruplicate millionnaire and in bust the railroad king. that be a day to be remember and it have only begin when we draw rein at a tiny farmhouse on the bank of the clackamas and seek horse fee and lodge ere we hasten to the river that break over a weir not a quarter of a mile away. 
imagine a stream seventy yard broad divide by a pebbly island run over seductive riffle and swirl into deep quiet pool where the good salmon go to smoke his pipe after meal. set such a stream amid field of breast high crop surround by hill of pine throw in where you please quiet water log fence meadow and a hundred foot bluff just to keep the scenery from grow too monotonous and you will get some faint notion of the clackamas. 
portland have no rod. he hold the gaff and the whisky. california sniff upstream and downstream across the race water choose his grind and let the gaudy spoon drop in the tail of a riffle. i be get my rod together when i hear the joyous shriek of the reel and the yell of california and three foot of live silver leap into the air far across the water. the force be engage. the salmon tear up stream the tense line cut the water like a tide rip behind him and the light bamboo bow to break. what happen after i cannot tell. california swear and pray and portland shout advice and i do all three for what appear to be half a day but be in reality a little over a quarter of an hour and sullenly our fish come home with spurt of temper dash head on and saraband in the air. but home to the bank come he and the remorseless reel gather up the thread of his life inch by inch. we land him in a little bay and the spring weight check at eleven and a half pound. eleven and one half pound of fight salmon. we dance a war dance on the pebble and california catch me round the waist in a hug that go near to break my rib while he shout. partner. partner. this be glory. now you catch your fish. twenty four year i ve wait for this. 
i go into that icy cold river and make my cast just above a weir and all but foul hook a blue and black water snake with a coral mouth who coil herself on a stone and hiss malediction. the next cast ah the pride of it the regal splendour of it. the thrill that run down from finger tip to toe. the water boil. he break for the spoon and get it. there remain enough sense in me to give him all he want when he jump not once but twenty time before the upstream flight that run my line out to the last half dozen turn and i saw the nickled reel bar glitter under the thin green coil. my thumb be burn deep when i strive to stopper the line but i do not feel it till late for my soul be out in the dance water pray for him to turn ere he take my tackle away. the prayer be hear. a i bow back the butt of the rod on my leave hip bone and the top joint dip like unto a weep willow he turn and i accept each inch of slack that i could by any mean get in a a favour from on high. there be several sort of success in this world that taste well in the moment of enjoyment but i question whether the stealthy theft of line from an able body salmon who know exactly what you be do and why you be do it be not sweet than any other victory within human scope. like california s fish he run at me head on and leap against the line but the lord give me two hundred and fifty pair of finger in that hour. the bank and the pine tree dance dizzily round me but i only reel reel a for life reel for hour and at the end of the reel continue to give him the butt while he sulk in a pool. california be farther up the reach and with the corner of my eye i could see him cast with long cast and much skill. then he strike and my fish break for the weir in the same instant and down the reach we come california and i. reel answer reel even a the morning star sing together. 
the first wild enthusiasm of capture have die away. we be both at work now in deadly earnest to prevent the line foul to stall off a downstream rush for deep water just above the weir and at the same time to get the fish into the shallow bay downstream that give the best practicable land. portland bid u both be of good heart and volunteer to take the rod from my hand. i would rather have die among the pebble than surrender my right to play and land my first salmon weight unknown on an eight ounce rod. i hear california at my ear it seem gasp. he s a fighter from fightersville sure. a his fish make a fresh break across the stream. i saw portland fall off a log fence break the overhang bank and clatter down to the pebble all sand and land net and i drop on a log to rest for a moment. a i draw breath the weary hand slacken their hold and i forget to give him the butt. a wild scutter in the water a plunge and a break for the head water of the clackamas be my reward and the hot toil of reel in with one eye under the water and the other on the top joint of the rod be renew. bad of all i be block california s path to the little land bay aforesaid and he have to halt and tire his prize where he be. the father of all salmon. he shout. for the love of heaven get your trout to bank johnny bull. but i could no more. even the insult fail to move me. the rest of the game be with the salmon. he suffer himself to be draw skip with pretend delight at get to the haven where i would fain have him. yet no sooner do he feel shoal water under his ponderous belly than he back like a torpedo boat and the snarl of the reel tell me that my labour be in vain. a dozen time at least this happen ere the line hint he have give up that battle and would be tow in. he be tow. the land net be useless for one of his size and i would not have him gaffed. i step into the shallow and heave him out with a respectful hand under the gill for which kindness he batter me about the leg with his tail and i felt the strength of him and be proud. california have take my place in the shallow his fish hard hold. i be up the bank lie full length on the sweet scent grass and gasp in company with my first salmon catch play and land on an eight ounce rod. my hand be cut and bleed. i be drip with sweat spangle like harlequin with scale wet from the waist down nose peel by the sun but utterly supremely and consummately happy. he the beauty the darling the daisy my salmon bahadur weigh twelve pound and i have be seven and thirty minute bring him to bank. he have be lightly hook on the angle of the right jaw and the hook have not weary him. that hour i sit among prince and crown head great than them all. below the bank we hear california scuffle with his salmon and swear spanish oath. portland and i assist at the capture and the fish drag the spring balance out by the root. it be only construct to weigh up to fifteen pound. we stretch the three fish on the grass the eleven and a half the twelve and fifteen pounder and we swear an oath that all who come after should merely be weigh and put back again. 
how shall i tell the glory of that day so that you may be interest. again and again do california and i prance down that reach to the little bay each with a salmon in tow and land him in the shallow. then portland take my rod and catch some ten pounder and my spoon be carry away by an unknown leviathan. each fish for the merit of the three that have die so gamely be hastily hook on the balance and fling back portland record the weight in a pocket book for he be a real estate man. each fish fight for all he be worth and none more savagely than the small a game little six pounder. at the end of six hour we add up the list. total. fish aggregate weight lb. the score in detail run something like this it be only interest to those concern. / / and so forth. a i have say nothing under six pound and three ten pounder. 
very solemnly and thankfully we put up our rod it be glory enough for all time and return weep in each other s arm weep tear of pure joy to that simple bare legged family in the pack case house by the waterside. the old farmer recollect day and night of fierce warfare with the indian way back in the fifty when every ripple of the columbia river and her tributary hide covert danger. god have dower him with a queer crook gift of expression and a fierce anxiety for the welfare of his two little son tan and reserve child who attend school daily and speak good english in a strange tongue. his wife be an austere woman who have once be kindly and perhaps handsome. many year of toil have take the elasticity out of step and voice. she look for nothing good than everlasting work the chafe detail of housework and then a grave somewhere up the hill among the blackberry and the pine. but in her grim way she sympathise with her eldest daughter a small and silent maiden of eighteen who have thought very far from the meal she tend or the pan she scour. we stumble into the household at a crisis. and there be a deal of downright humanity in that same. a bad wicked dressmaker have promise the maiden a dress in time for a to morrow s railway journey and though the barefooted georgie who stand in very wholesome awe of his sister have scour the wood on a pony in search that dress never arrive. so with sorrow in her heart and a hundred sister anne glance up the road she wait upon the stranger and i doubt not curse them for the want that stand between her and her need for tear. it be a genuine little tragedy. the mother in a heavy passionless voice rebuke her impatience yet sit bow over a heap of sew for the daughter s benefit. these thing i behold in the long marigold scent twilight and whisper night loaf round the little house with california who unfold himself like a lotus to the moon. or in the little board bunk that be our bedroom swap tale with portland and the old man. most of the yarn begin in this way. red larry be a bull puncher back of lone county montanna or there be a man rid the trail meet a jack rabbit sit in a cactus or bout the time of the san diego land boom a woman from monterey etc. you can try to piece out for yourselves what sort of story they be. 
and next day california tuck me under his wing and tell me we be go to see a city smite by a boom and catch trout. so we take a train and kill a cow she wouldn t get out of the way and the locomotive chance her and slew and cross into washington territory win the town of tacoma which stand at the head of puget sound upon the road to alaska and vancouver. 
california be right. tacoma be literally stagger under a boom of the boomiest. i do not quite remember what her natural resource be suppose to be though every second man shriek a selection in my ear. they include coal and iron carrot potato lumber ship and a crop of thin newspaper all tell portland that her day be number. california and i strike the place at twilight. the rude board pavement of the main street rumble under the heel of hundred of furious men all actively engage in hunt drink and eligible corner lot. they seek the drink first. the street itself alternate five storey business block of the late and more abominable form of architecture with board shanty. overhead the drunken telegraph telephone and electric light wire tangle on the totter post whose butt be half whittle through by the knife of the loafer. down the muddy grimy unmetalled thoroughfare run a horse car line the metal three inch above road level. beyond this street rise many hill and the town be throw like a break set of domino over all. a steam tramway it leave the track the only time i use it be nose about the hill but the most prominent feature of the landscape be the foundation in brick and stone of a gigantic opera house and the blacken stump of the pine. california size up the town with one comprehensive glance. big boom say he. and a few instant late. about time to step off i think mean thereby that the boom have rise to it limit and it would be expedient not to meddle with it. we pass down ungraded street that end abruptly in a fifteen foot drop and a nest of bramble. along pavement that begin in pine plank end in the live tree. by hotel with turkish mosque trinketry on their shameless top and the pine stamp at their very door. by a female seminary tall gaunt and red which a native of the town bid u marvel at and we marvel. by house build in imitation of the one on nob hill san francisco after the dutch fashion. by other house plenteously befoul with jig saw work and others flare with the castlemented battlemented bosh of the wooden gothic school. 
you can tell just about when those feller have their house build quoth california. that one yonder want to be i_talian and his architect build him what he want. the new house with the low straddle roof and window pitch in sideways and red brick wall be dutch. that s the late idea. i can read the history of the town. i have no occasion so to read. the native be only too glad and too proud to tell me. the hotel wall bore a flame panorama of tacoma in which by the eye of faith i saw a faint resemblance to the real town. the hotel stationary advertise that tacoma bore on it face all the advantage of the high civilisation and the newspaper sing the same tune in a loud key. the real estate agent be sell house lot on unmake street mile away for thousand of dollar. on the street the rude crude street where the unshaded electric light be fight with the gentle northern twilight men be babble of money town lot and again money how alf or ed have do such and such a thing that have bring him so much money. and round the corner in a creak board hall the red jerseyed salvationists be call upon mankind to renounce all and follow their noisy god. the men drop in by two and three listen silently for a while and a silently go their way the cymbal clash after them in vain. i think it be the raw new smell of fresh sawdust everywhere pervade the air that throw upon me a desolate homesickness. it bring back in a moment all remembrance of that terrible first night at school when the establishment ha be newly whitewash and a soft smell of escape gas mingle with the odour of trunk and wet overcoat. i be a little boy and the school be very new. a vagabond among collarless vagabond i loaf up the street look into the front of little shop where they sell slop shirt at fancy price which shop i saw late describe in the paper a great. california have go off to investigate on his own account and presently return laugh noiselessly. they be all mad here he say all mad. a man nearly pull a gun on me because i didn t agree with him that tacoma be go to whip san francisco on the strength of carrot and potato. i ask him to tell me what the town produce and i couldn t get anything out of him except those two darn vegetable. say what do you think. 
i respond firmly i m go into british territory a little while to draw breath. 
i m go up the sound too for a while say he but i m come back come back to our salmon on the clackamas. a man ha be press me to buy real estate here. young feller don t you buy real estate here. 
california disappear with a kindly wave of his overcoat into world other than mine good luck go with him for he be a true sportsman. and i take a steamer up puget sound for vancouver which be the terminus of the canadian pacific railway. that be a queer voyage. the water landlocked among a thousand island lay still a oil under our bow and the wake of the screw break up the unquivering reflection of pine and cliff a mile away. twas a though we be trample on glass. no one not even the government know the number of island in the sound. even now you can get one almost for the ask. can build a house raise sheep catch salmon and become a king on a small scale your subject the indian of the reservation who glide among the islet in their canoe and scratch their hide monkeywise by the beach. a sound indian be unlovely and only by accident picturesque. his wife drive the canoe but he himself be so thorough a mariner that he can spring up in his cockle craft and whack his wife over the head with a paddle without tip the whole affair into the water. this i have see him do unprovoked. i fancy it must have be to show off before the white. 
have i tell you anything about seattle the town that be burn out a few week ago when the insurance men at san francisco take their loss with a grin. in the ghostly twilight just a the forest fire be begin to glare from the unthrifty island we strike it strike it heavily for the wharf have all be burn down and we tie up where we could crash into the rotten foundation of a boathouse a a pig root in high grass. the town like tacoma be build upon a hill. in the heart of the business quarter there be a horrible black smudge a though a hand have come down and rub the place smooth. i know now what be wipe out mean. the smudge seem to be about a mile long and it blackness be relieve by tent in which men be do business with the wreck of the stock they have save. there be shout and counter shout from the steamer to the temporary wharf which be lade with shingle for roof chair trunk provision box and all the lath and string arrangement out of which a western town be make. this be the way the shout run. 
oh george. what s the best with you. 
nawthin. get the old safe out. she s burn to a crisp. book all go. 
save anythin. 
bar l o cracker and my wife s bonnet. goin to start store on them though. 
bully for you. where s that emporium. i ll drop in. 
corner what use to be fourth and main little brown tent close to militia picquet. sa ay. we re under martial law an all the saloon be shut down. 
best for you george. some men get crazy with a fire an liquor make em crazy. 
spect any creator condemn son of a female dog who ha lose all his fixin s in a conflagration be go to put ice on his head an run for congress do you. how d you like u act. 
the job s comforter on the steamer retire into himself. 
oh george dive into the bar for a drink. 
p. s. among many curiosity i have unearth one. it be a face on the steamer a face above a point straw colour beard a face with thin lip and eloquent eye. we converse and presently i get at the idea of the face. it be though it live for nine month of the year in the wild of alaska and british columbia an authority on the canon law of the church of england a zealous and bitter upholder of the supremacy of the aforesaid church. into my amaze ear a the steamer plod through the reflection of the star it pour the battle cry of the church militant here on earth and put forward a a foul injustice that in the prison of british columbia the protestant chaplain do not always belong to the church. the face have no official connection with the august body and by force of his life very seldom attend service. 
but say he proudly i should think it direct disobedience to the order of my church if i attend any other place of worship than those prescribe. i be once for three month in a place where there be only a wesleyan methodist chapel and i never set foot in it once sir. never once. twould have be heresy. rank heresy. 
and a i lean over the rail methought that all the little star in the water be shake with austere merriment. but it may have be only the ripple of the steamer after all. 
no. xxviii. 
take me from vancouver to the yellowstone national park. 
but who shall chronicle the way of common folk the night and day spend with rough goatherd on the snow and traveller come whence no man know. 
this day i know how a deserter feel. here in victoria a hundred and forty mile out of america the mail bring me news from our home the land of regret. i be enjoy myself by the side of a trout stream and i feel incline to apologise for every rejoice breath i draw in the diamond clear air. the sickness they say be heavy with you. from rewari to the south good men be die. two name come in by the mail of two strong men dead men that i din and jest with only a little time ago and it seem unfair that i should be here cut off from the chain gang and the shoot drill of our weary life. after all there be no life like it that we lead over yonder. american be american and there be million of them. english be english. but we of india be u all the world over know the mystery of each other s life and sorrow for the death of a brother. how can i sit down and write to you of the mere joy of be alive. the news ha kill the pleasure of the day for me and i be ashamed of myself. there be seventy brook trout lie in a creel fresh draw from harrison hot spring and they do not console me. they be like the steal apple that clinch the fact of a bad boy s play truant. i would sell them all with my heritage in the wood and air and the delight of meet new and strange people just to be back again in the old gall harness the heat and the dust the gathering in the evening by the flood tennis court the ghastly dull dinner at the club when the very last woman ha be pack off to the hill and the four or five survive men ask the doctor the symptom of incubate smallpox. i should be trouble in body but at peace in the soul. o excellent and toil wear public of mine men of the brotherhood griffin new join from the february trooper and gentleman wait for your off reckoning take care of yourselves and keep well. it hurt so when any die. there be so few of u and we know one another too intimately. 
* * * * *. 
vancouver three year ago be sweep off by fire in sixteen minute and only one house be leave stand. to day it ha a population of fourteen thousand people and build it house out of brick with dress granite front. but a great sleepiness lie on vancouver a compare with an american town. men don t fly up and down the street tell lie and the spittoon in the delightfully comfortable hotel be unused. the bath be free and their door be unlock. you do not have to dig up the hotel clerk when you want to bathe which show the inferiority of vancouver. an american bid me notice the absence of bustle and be alarm when in a loud and audible voice i thank god for it. give me granite hew granite and peace quoth i and keep your deal board and bustle for yourselves. 
the canadian pacific terminus be not a very gorgeous place a yet but you can be shoot directly from the window of the train into the liner that will take you in fourteen day from vancouver to yokohama. the parthia_ of some five thousand ton be at her berth when i come and the sight of the ex cunard on what seem to be a little lake be curious. except for certain current which be not much mention but which make the entrance rather unpleasant for sail boat vancouver posse an almost perfect harbour. the town be build all round and about the harbour and young a it be it street be good than those of western america. moreover the old flag wave over some of the building and this be cheer to the soul. the place be full of englishman who speak the english tongue correctly and with clearness avoid more blasphemy than be necessary and take a respectable length of time to get outside their drink. these advantage and others that i have hear about such a the construction of elaborate workshop and the like by the canadian pacific in the near future move me to invest in real estate. he that sell it me be a delightful english boy who have try for the army and fail have somehow meander into a real estate office where he be do well. i couldn t have buy it from an american. he would have overstate the case and prove me the possessor of the original eden. all the boy say be. i give you my word it isn t on a cliff or under water and before long the town ought to move out that way. i d advise you to take it. and i take it a easily a a man buy a piece of tobacco. me voici_ owner of some four hundred well develop pine a few thousand ton of granite scatter in block at the root of the pine and a sprinkle of earth. that s a town lot in vancouver. you or your agent hold to it till property rise then sell out and buy more land further out of town and repeat the process. i do not quite see how this sort of thing help the growth of a town but the english boy say that it be the essence of speculation so it must be all right. but i wish there be few pine and rather le granite on my grind. move by curiosity and the lust of trout i go seventy mile up the canadian pacific in one of the cross continent car which be clean and le stuffy than the pullman. a man who go all the way across canada be liable to be disappoint not in the scenery but in the progress of the country. so a batch of wander politician from england tell me. they even go so far a to say that eastern canada be a failure and unprofitable. the place didn t move they complain and whole county they say province lay under the rule of the roman catholic priest who take care that the people should not be overcumbered with the good thing of this world to the detriment of their soul. my interest be in the line the real and accomplish railway which be to throw actual fight troop into the east some day when our hold of the suez canal be temporarily loosen. 
all that vancouver want be a fat earthwork fort upon a hill there be plenty of hill to choose from a selection of big gun a couple of regiment of infantry and late on a big arsenal. the raw self consciousness of america would be sure to make her think these arrangement intend for her benefit but she could be enlighten. it be not seemly to leave unprotected the head end of a big railway. for though victoria and esquimalt our naval station on vancouver island be very near so also be a place call vladivostok and though vancouver narrow be strait they allow room enough for a man of war. the people i do not speak to more than two hundred of them do not know about russia or military arrangement. they be try to open trade with japan in lumber and be raise fruit wheat and sometimes mineral. all of them agree that we do not yet know the resource of british columbia and all joyfully bid me note the climate which be distinctly warm. we never have kill cold here. it s the most perfect climate in the world. then there be three perfect climate for i have taste em california washington territory and british columbia. i cannot say which be the lovely. 
when i leave by steamer and strike across the sound to our naval station at victoria vancouver island i find in that quite english town of beautiful street quite a colony of old men do nothing but talk fish and loaf at the club. that mean that the retire go to victoria. on a thousand a year pension a man would be a millionnaire in these part and for four hundred he could live well. it be at victoria they tell me the tale of the fire in vancouver. how the inhabitant of new westminster twelve mile from vancouver saw a glare in the sky at six in the even but think it be a forest fire. how late bit of burn paper fly about their street and they guess that evil have happen. how an hour late a man ride into the city cry that there be no vancouver leave. all have be wipe out by the flame in sixteen minute. how two hour late the mayor of new westminster have vote nine thousand dollar from the municipal fund relief wagon with food and blanket be pour into where vancouver stand. how fourteen people be suppose to have die in the fire but how even now when they lay new foundation the workman unearth char skeleton many more than fourteen. that night say the teller all vancouver be houseless. the wooden town have go in a breath. next day they begin to build in brick and you have see what they have achieve. 
the sight afar off of three british men of war and a torpedo boat console me a i return from victoria to tacoma and discover en route that i be surfeit with scenery. there be a great deal in the remark of a discontent traveller. when you have see a fine forest a bluff a river and a lake you have see all the scenery of western america. sometimes the pine be three hundred foot high and sometimes the rock be and sometimes the lake be a hundred mile long. but it s all the same don t you know. i m get sick of it. i dare not say get sick. i m only tire. if providence could distribute all this beauty in little bit where people most want it among you in india it would be well. but it be en masse_ overwhelm with nobody but the tobacco chew captain of a river steamboat to look at it. men say if i go to alaska i should see island even more wooded snow peak lofty and river more lovely than those around me. that decide me not to go to alaska. i go east east to montana after another horrible night in tacoma among the men who spat. why doe the western spit. it can t amuse him and it doesn t interest his neighbour. 
but i be begin to mistrust. everything good a well a everything bad be suppose to come from the east. be there a shoot scrape between prominent citizen. oh you ll find nothing of that kind in the east. be there a more than usually revolt lynch. they don t do that in the east. i shall find out when i get there whether this unnatural perfection be real. 
eastward then to montana i take my way for the yellowstone national park call in the guide book wonderland. but the real wonderland begin in the train. we be a merry crew. one gentleman announce his intention of pay no fare and grapple the conductor who neatly cross buttocked him through a double plate glass window. his head be cut open in four or five place. a doctor on the train hastily stitch up the big gash and he be drop at a wayside station spurt blood at every hair a scarlet head and ghastly sight. the conductor guess that he would die and volunteer the information that there be no profit in monkey with the north pacific railway. 
night be fall a we clear the forest and sail out upon a wilderness of sage brush. the desolation of montgomery the wilderness of sind the hummock stud desert of bikaneer be joyous and homelike compare to the impoverish misery of the sage. it be blue it be stunt it be dusty. it wrap the roll hill a a mildew shroud wrap the body of a long dead man. it make you weep for sheer loneliness and there be no get away from it. when childe roland come to the dark tower he traverse the sage brush. 
yet there be one thing bad than sage unadulterated and that be a prairie city. we stop at pasco junction and a man tell me that it be the queen city of the prairie. i wish american didn t tell such useless lie. i count fourteen or fifteen frame house and a portion of a road that show like a bruise on the untouched surface of the blue sage run away and away up to the set sun. the sailor sleep with a half inch plank between himself and death. he be at home beside the handful of people who curl themselves up o night with nothing but a frail scantling almost a thin a a blanket to shut out the unmeasurable loneliness of the sage. 
when the train stop on the road a it do once or twice the solid silence of the sage get up and shout at u. it be like a nightmare and one not in the least improve by have to sleep in an emigrant car. the regularly ordain sleeper be full. there be a row in our car toward morning a man have manage to get querulously drink in the night. up rise a cornishman with a red head full of strategy and strap the obstreperous one smile largely a he do so and a delicate little woman in a far bunk watch the fray and call the drunken man a damn hog which he certainly be though she needn t have put it quite so coarsely. emigrant car be clean but the accommodation be a hard a a plank bed. 
late we lay our bone down to cross the rockies. an american train can climb up the side of a house if need be but it be not pleasant to sit in it. we clomb till we strike violent cold and an indian reservation and the noble savage come to look at u. he be a flathead and unlovely. most american be charmingly frank about the indian. let u get rid of him a soon a possible they say. we have no use for him. some of the men i meet have a notion that we in india be exterminate the native in the same fashion and i have be ask to fix a date for the final extinguishment of the aryan. i answer that it will be a long business. very many american have an offensive habit of refer to native a heathen. mahometans and hindu be heathen alike in their eye and they vary the epithet with pagan and idolater. but this be beside the matter which be the stampede tunnel our actual point of cross the rockies. thank heaven i need never take that tunnel again. it be about two mile long and in effect be nothing more than the gallery of a mine shore with timber and light with electric lamp. black darkness would be preferable for the lamp just reveal the rough cut of the rock and that be very rough indeed. the train crawl through brake down and you can hear the water and little bit of stone fall on the roof of the car. then you pray pray fervently and the air get still and still and you dare not take your unwilling eye off the timber shore l a prop should fall for lack of your moral support. before the tunnel be build you cross in the open air by a switchback line. a watchman go through the tunnel after each train but that be no protection. he just guess that another train will pull through and the engine driver guess the same thing. some day between the two of them there will be a cave in the tunnel. then the enterprising reporter will talk about the shriek and groan of the bury and the heroic effort of the press in secure first information and that will be all. human life be of small account out here. 
i be listen to yarn in the smoke compartment of the pullman all the way to helena and with very few exception each have for it point violent brutal and ruffianly murder murder by fraud and the craft of the savage murder unavenged by the law or at the most by an outbreak of fresh lawlessness. at the end of each tale i be assure that the old day have pass away and that these be anecdote of five year stand. one man in particular distinguish himself by hold up to admiration the exploit of some cowboy of his acquaintance and their skill in the use of the revolver. each tale of horror wind up with and that s the sort of man he be a who should say. go and do likewise. remember that the shooting the cutting and the stabbings be not the outcome of any specie of legitimate warfare. the hero be not force to fight for their life. far from it. the brawl be breed by liquor in which they assist in saloon and gamble hell they be wont to pull their gun on a man and in the vast majority of case without provocation. the tale sicken me but teach one thing. a man who carry a pistol may be put down a a coward a person to be shut out from every decent mess and club and gather of civilise folk. there be neither chivalry nor romance in the weapon for all that american author have see fit to write. i would i could make you understand the full measure of contempt with which certain aspect of western life have inspire me. let u try a comparison. sometimes it happen that a young a very young man whose first dress coat be yet glossy get slightly flush at a dinner party among his senior. after the lady be go he begin to talk. he talk you will remember a a man of the world and a person of vary experience an authority on all thing human and divine. the grey head of the elder bow assentingly to his wild statement. some one try to turn the conversation when what the youngster conceive to be wit ha offend a sensibility. and another deftly slide the decanter beyond him a they circle round the table. you know the feel of discomfort pity mingle with aversion over the boy who be make an exhibition of himself. the same emotion come back to me when an old man who ought to have know good appeal from time to time for admiration of his pitiful sentiment. it be right in his mind to insult to maim and to kill. right to evade the law where it be strong and to trample over it where it be weak. right to swindle in politics to lie in affair of state and commit perjury in matter of municipal administration. the car be full of little child utterly regardless of their parent fretful peevish spoil beyond anything i have ever see in anglo india. they in time would grow up into men such a sit in the smoker and have no regard for the law. men who would conduct paper side with defiance of any and every law. but it s of no consequence a mr. toot say. 
during the descent of the rockies we journey for a season on a trestle only two hundred and eighty six foot high. it be make of iron but up till two year ago a wooden structure bore up the train and be use long after it have be condemn by the civil engineer. some day the iron one will come down just a stampede tunnel will and the result will be even more startle. 
late in the night we run over a skunk run over it in the dark. everything that ha be say about the skunk be true. it be an awesome stink. 
no. xxix. 
show how yankee jim introduce me to diana of the crossway on the bank of the yellowstone and how a german jew say i be no true citizen. end with the celebration of the th of july and a few lesson therefrom. 
livingstone be a town of two thousand people and the junction for the little side line that take you to the yellowstone national park. it lie in a fold of the prairie and behind it be the yellowstone river and the gate of the mountain through which the river flow. there be one street in the town where the cowboy s pony and the little foal of the brood mare in the buggy rest contentedly in the blind sunshine while the cowboy get himself shave at the only other barber s shop and swap lie at the bar. i exhaust the town include the saloon in ten minute and get away on the roll grass down where i throw myself to rest. directly under the hill i be on sweep a drive of horse in charge of two mount men. that be a picture i shall not soon forget. a light haze of dust go up from the hoof tread green scarcely veil the unfettered deviltry of three hundred horse who very much want to stop and graze. yow. yow. yow. yap the mount men in chorus like coyote. the column move forward at a trot divide a it meet a hillock and scatter into fan shape all among the suburb of livingstone. i hear the snick of a stock whip half a dozen yow yows and the mob have come together again and with neigh and whicker and squeal and a great deal of kick on the part of the youngster roll like a wave of brown water toward the upland. 
i be within twenty foot of the leader a grey stallion lord of many brood mare all deeply concern for the welfare of their fuzzy foal. a cream colour beast i know him at once for the bad character of the troop break back take with him some frivolous filly. i hear the snick of the whip somewhere in the dust and the filly come back at a canter very shock and indignant. on the heel of the last ride both the stockman picturesque ruffian who want to know what in hell i be do there wave their hat and speed down the slope after their charge. when the noise of the troop have die there come a wonderful silence on all the prairie that silence they say which enter into the heart of the old time hunter and trapper and mark him off from the rest of his race. the town disappear in the darkness and a very young moon show herself over a bald head snow fleck peak. then the yellowstone hide by the water willow lift up it voice and sing a little song to the mountain and an old horse that have creep up in the dusk breathe inquiringly on the back of my neck. when i reach the hotel i find all manner of preparation under way for the th of july and a drunken man with a winchester rifle over his shoulder patrol the sidewalk. i do not think he want any one. he carry the gun a other folk carry walk stick. none the le i avoid the direct line of fire and listen to the blasphemy of miner and stockman till far into the night. in every bar room lay a copy of the local paper and every copy impress it upon the inhabitant of livingstone that they be the best fine brave rich and most progressive town of the most progressive nation under heaven. even a the tacoma and portland paper have belauded their reader. and yet all my purblind eye could see be a grubby little hamlet full of men without clean collar and perfectly unable to get through one sentence unadorned by three oath. they raise horse and mineral round and about livingstone but they behave a though they raise cherubims with diamond in their wing. 
from livingstone the national park train follow the yellowstone river through the gate of the mountain and over arid volcanic country. a strange in the car saw me look at the ideal trout stream below the window and murmur softly. lie off at yankee jim s if you want good fish. they halt the train at the head of a narrow valley and i leap literally into the arm of yankee jim sole owner of a log hut an indefinite amount of hay grind and constructor of twenty seven mile of wagon road over which he hold toll right. there be the hut the river fifty yard away and the polish line of metal that disappear round a bluff. that be all. the railway add the finish touch to the already complete loneliness of the place. yankee jim be a picturesque old man with a talent for yarn that ananias might have envy. it seem to me presumptuous in my ignorance that i might hold my own with the old timer if i judiciously paint up a few lie gather in the course of my wandering. yankee jim saw every one of my tale and go fifty good on the spot. he deal in bear and indian never le than twenty of each. have know the yellowstone country for year and bore upon his body mark of indian arrow. and his eye have see a squaw of the crow indian burn alive at the stake. he say she scream considerable. in one point do he speak the truth a regard the merit of that particular reach of the yellowstone. he say it be alive with trout. it be. i fish it from noon till twilight and the fish bite at the brown hook a though never a fat trout fly have fall on the water. from pebbly reach quiver in the heat haze where the foot catch on stump cut foursquare by the chisel tooth of the beaver. past the fringe of the water willow crowd with the breed trout fly and alive with toad and water snake. over the drift timber to the grateful shadow of big tree that darken the hole where the fat fish lay i work for seven hour. the mountain flank on either side of the valley give back the heat a the desert give it and the dry sand by the railway track where i find a rattlesnake be hot iron to the touch. but the trout do not care for the heat. they breast the boil river for my fly and they get it. i simply dare not give my bag. at the fortieth trout i give up count and i have leach the fortieth in le than two hour. they be small fish not one over two pound but they fight like small tiger and i lose three fly before i could understand their method of escape. ye god. that be fish though it peel the skin from my nose in strip. 
at twilight yankee jim bore me off protest to supper in the hut. the fish have prepare me for any surprise wherefore when yankee jim introduce me to a young woman of five and twenty with eye like the deep fringe eye of the gazelle and on the neck the small head buoyant like a bell flower in it bed i say nothing. it be all in the day s event. she be california raise the wife of a man who own a stock farm up the river a little way and with her husband tenant of yankee jim s shanty. i know she wear list slipper and do not wear stay. but i know also that she be beautiful by any standard of beauty and that the trout she cook be fit for a king s supper. and after supper strange men loaf up in the dim delicious twilight with the little news of the day how a heifer have go stray from nicholson s. how the widow at grant s fork wouldn t part with a little hayland nohow though she s an her big brother can t manage more than ha af their land now. she s so darn proud. diana of the crossway entertain them in queenly wise and her husband and yankee jim bid them sit right down and make themselves at home. then do yankee jim uncurl his choice lie on indian warfare aforetime. then do the whisky flask circle round the little crowd. then do diana s husband low that he be quite handy with the lariat but have see men rope a steer by any foot or horn indicate. then do diana unburden herself about her neighbour. the near house be three mile away but the woman aren t nice neighbourly folk. they talk so. they haven t get anything else to do seemingly. if a woman go to a dance and ha a good time they talk and if she wear a silk dress they want to know how jest ranchin folk folk on a ranche come by such thing. and they make mischief down all the land here from gardiner city way back up to livingstone. they re mostly montanna raise and they haven t be nowhere. ah how they talk. be thing like this demand diana in the big world outside whence i have come. yes i say thing be very much the same all over the world and i think of a far away station in india where new dress and the have of good time at dance raise cackle more grammatical perhaps but no le venomous than the gossip of the montanna raise folk on the ranch of the yellowstone. 
next morn i fish again and listen to diana tell the story of her life. i forget what she tell me but i be distinctly aware that she have royal eye and a mouth that the daughter of a hundred earl might have envy so small and so delicately cut it be. an you come back an see u again say the simple mind folk. come back an we ll show you how to catch six pound trout at the head of the ca√±on. 
to day i be in the yellowstone park and i wish i be dead. the train halt at cinnabar station and we be decant a howl crowd of u into stage variously horse for the eight mile drive to the first spectacle of the park a place call the mammoth hot spring. what mean this eager anxious throng. i ask the driver. you ve strike one of rayment s excursion party that s all a crowd of creator condemn fool mostly. aren t you one of em. no i say. may i sit up here with you great chief and man with a golden tongue. i do not know mister rayment. i belong to t. cook and son. the other person from the quality of the material he handle must be the son of a sea cook. he collect mass of down easter from the new england state and elsewhere and hurl them across the continent and into the yellowstone park on tour. a brake load of cook s continental tourist trapezing through paris. i ve see em. be angel of light compare to the rayment tripper. it be not the ghastly vulgarity the ooze rampant bessemer steel self sufficiency and ignorance of the men that revolt me so much a the display of these same quality in the woman folk. i saw a new type in the coach and all my dream of a good and more perfect east die away. be these um person here any sort of person in their own place. i ask a shepherd who appear to be herd them. 
why certainly. they include very many prominent and representative citizen from seven state of the union and most of them be wealthy. yes sir. representative and prominent. 
we run across bare hill on an unmetalled road under a burn sun in front of a volley of playful repartee from the prominent citizen inside. it be the th of july. the horse have american flag in their head stall some of the woman wear flag and colour handkerchief in their belt and a young german on the box seat with me be bewail the loss of a box of cracker. he say he have be send to the continent to get his school and so have lose his american accent. but no continental school write german jew all over a man s face and nose. he be a rabid american citizen one of a very difficult class to deal with. a a general rule praise unsparingly and without discrimination. that keep most men quiet. but some if you fail to keep up a continuous stream of praise proceed to revile the old country german and irish who be more american than the american be the chief offender. this young american begin to attack the english army. he have see some of it on parade and he pity the men in bearskin a slave. the citizen by the way ha a contempt for his own army which exceed anything you meet among the most illiberal class in england. i admit that our army be very poor have do nothing and have be nowhere. this exasperate him for he expect an argument and he trample on the british lion generally. fail to move me he vow that i have no patriotism like his own. i say i have not and further venture that very few englishman have. which when you come to think of it be quite true. by the time he have prove conclusively that before the prince of wale come to the throne we should be a blether republic we strike a road that overhang a river and my interest in politics be lose in admiration of the driver s skill a he send his four big horse along that wind road. there be no room for any sort of accident a shy or a swerve would have drop u sixty foot into the roar gardiner river. some of the person in the coach remark that the scenery be elegant. wherefore even at the risk of my own life i do urgently desire an accident and the massacre of some of the more prominent citizen. what elegance lie in a thousand foot pile of honey colour rock rive into peak and battlement the high peak defiantly crown by an eagle s nest the eaglet peer into the gulf and scream for his food i could not for the life of me understand. but they speak a strange tongue. 
en route we pass other carriage full of tripper who have do their appoint five day in the park and yelp at u fraternally a they disappear in cloud of red dust. when we strike the mammoth hot spring hotel a huge yellow barn a sign board inform u that the altitude be six thousand two hundred foot. the park be just a howl wilderness of three thousand square mile full of all imaginable freak of a fiery nature. an hotel company assist by the secretary of state for the interior appear to control it. there be hotel at all the point of interest guide book stall for the sale of mineral and so forth after the model of swiss summer place. 
the tourist may their master die an evil death at the hand of a mad locomotive. pour into that place with a joyful whoop and scarce wash the dust from themselves begin to celebrate the th of july. they call it patriotic exercise. elect a clergyman of their own faith a president and sit on the land of the first floor begin to make speech and read the declaration of independence. the clergyman rise up and tell them they be the great free sublime most chivalrous and rich people on the face of the earth and they all say amen. another clergyman assert in the word of the declaration that all men be create equal and equally entitle to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. i should like to know whether the wild and woolly west recognise this first right a freely a the grantor intend. the clergyman then bid the world note that the tourist include representative of seven of the new england state. whereat i felt deeply sorry for the new england state in their latter day. he opine that this run to and fro upon the earth under the auspex of the excellent rayment would draw america more closely together especially when the westerner remember the peril that they of the east have surmount by rail and river. at duly appoint interval the congregation sing my country ti of thee to the tune of god save the queen. here they do not stand up. and the star spangle banner. here they do. wind up the exercise with some doggrel of their own composition to the tune of john brown s body movingly set forth the peril before allude to. they then adjourn to the verandah and watch fire cracker of the feeble explode one by one for several hour. 
what amaze me be the calm with which these folk gather together and commence to belaud their noble self their country and their institootions and everything else that be theirs. the language be to these bewilder ear wild advertisement gas bunkum blow anything you please beyond the bound of common sense. an archangel sell town lot on the glassy sea would have blush to the tip of his wing to describe his property in similar term. then they gather round the pastor and tell him his little sermon be perfectly glorious really grand sublime and so forth and he bridle ecclesiastically. at the end a perfectly unknown man attack me and ask me what i think of american patriotism. i say there be nothing like it in the old country. by the way always tell an american this. it soothe him. 
then say he. be you go to get out your letter your letter of naturalisation. 
why. i ask. 
i presoom you do business in this country and make money out of it and it seem to me that it would be your dooty. 
sir say i sweetly there be a forget little island across the sea call england. it be not much big than the yellowstone park. in that island a man of your country could work marry make his fortune or twenty fortune and die. throughout his career not one soul would ask him whether he be a british subject or a child of the devil. do you understand. 
i think he do because he say something about britisher which wasn t complimentary. 
no. xxx. 
show how i enter mazanderan of the persian and saw devil of every colour and some trooper. hell and the old lady from chicago. the captain and the lieutenant. 
that desolate land and lone where the big horn and yellowstone roar down their mountain path. 
twice have i write this letter from end to end. twice have i tear it up fear l those across the water should say that i have go mad on a sudden. now we will begin for the third time quite solemnly and soberly. i have be through the yellowstone national park in a buggy in the company of an adventurous old lady from chicago and her husband who disapprove of scenery a be ongodly. i fancy it scar them. 
we begin a you know with the mammoth hot spring. they be only a gigantic edition of those pink and white terrace not long ago destroy by earthquake in new zealand. at one end of the little valley in which the hotel stand the lime lade spring that break from the pine cover hillside have form a freeze cataract of white lemon and pale pink formation through and over and in which water of the warm bubble and drip and trickle from pale green lagoon to exquisitely fret basin. the grind ring hollow a a kerosene tin and some day the mammoth hotel guest and all will sink into the cavern below and be turn into a stalactite. when i set foot on the first of the terrace a tourist trample ramp of scabby grey stuff i meet a stream of iron red hot water which duck into a hole like a rabbit. follow a gentle chuckle of laughter and then a deep exhaust sigh from nowhere in particular. fifty foot above my head a jet of steam rise up and die out in the blue. it be bad than the boil mountain at myanoshita. the dirty white deposit give place to lime white than snow. and i find a basin which some learn hotel keeper ha christen cleopatra s pitcher or mark antony s whisky jug or something equally poetical. it be make of frost silver. it be fill with water a clear a the sky. i do not know the depth of that wonder. the eye look down beyond grotto and cave of beryl into an aby that communicate directly with the central fire of earth. and the pool be in pain so that it could not refrain from talk about it. mutter and chatter and moan. from the lip of the lime ledge forty foot under water spurt of silver bubble would fly up and break the peace of the crystal atop. then the whole pool would shake and grow dim and there be noise. i remove myself only to find other pool all equally unhappy rift in the grind full of run red hot water slippery sheet of deposit overlay with greenish grey hot water and here and there pit hole dry a a rifle tomb in india dusty and waterless. elsewhere the infernal water have first boil dead and then embalm the pine and underwood or the forest tree have take heart and smother up a blind formation with greenery so that it be only by scrap the earth you could tell what fire have rag beneath. yet the pine will win the battle in year to come because nature who first forge all her work in her great smithy ha nearly finish this job and be ready to temper it in the soft brown earth. the fire be die down. the hotel be build where terrace have overflow into flat waste of deposit. the pine have take possession of the high grind whence the terrace first start. only the actual curve of the cataract stand clear and it be guard by soldier who patrol it with load six shooter in order that the tourist may not bring up fence rail and sink them in a pool or chip the fret tracery of the formation with a geological hammer or walk where the crust be too thin foolishly cook himself. 
i manoeuvre round those soldier. they be cavalry in a very slovenly uniform dark blue blouse and light blue trouser unstrapped cut spoon shape over the boot. cartridge belt revolver peak cap and worst glove black button. by the mercy of allah i open conversation with a spectacled scot. he have serve the queen in the marine and a line regiment and the go fever be in his bone have drift to america there to serve uncle sam. we sit on the edge of an extinct little pool that under happy circumstance would have grow into a geyser and begin to discus thing generally. to u appear yet another soldier. no need to ask his nationality or to be tell that the troop call him the henglishman. a cockney be he who have see something of warfare in egypt and have take his discharge from a fusilier regiment not unknown to you. 
and how do thing go. 
very much a you please say they. there s not half the discipline here that there be in the queen s service not half nor the work either but what there be be rough work. why there s a sergeant now with a black eye that one of our men give him. they win t say anything about that of course. our punishment. fine mostly and then if you carry on too much you go to the cool that s the clink. yes sir. horse. oh they re devil these montanna horse. broncho mostly. we don t slick em up for parade not much. and the amount of school that you put into one english troop horse would be enough for a whole squadron of these creature. you ll meet more trooper further up the park. go and look at their horse and their turnout. i fancy it ll startle you. i m wear a make tie and a breastpin under my blouse. of course i be. i can wear anything i darn please. we aren t particular here. i shouldn t dare come on parade no nor yet fatigue duty in this condition in the old country. but it don t matter here. but don t you forget sir that it s teach me how to trust to myself and my shoot iron. i don t want fifty order to move me across the park and catch a poacher. yes they poach here. men come in with an outfit and pony smuggle in a gun or two and shoot the bison. if you interfere they shoot at you. then you confiscate all their outfit and their pony. we have a pound full of them now down below. there s our captain over yonder. speak to him if you want to know anything special. this service isn t a patch on the old country s service. but you look if it be work up it would be just a hell of a service. but these citizen despise u and they put u on to road mend and such like. nough to ruin any army. 
to the captain i address myself after my friend have go. they tell me that a good many american officer dress by the french army. the captain certainly might have be mistake for a french officer of light cavalry and he have more than the courtesy of a frenchman. yes he have read a good deal about our indian border warfare and have be much strike with the liken it bore to red indian warfare. i have good when i reach the next cavalry post scatter between two big geyser basin introduce myself to a captain and lieutenant. they could show me thing. he himself be devote all his time to conserve the terrace and surreptitiously run hot water into dry up basin that fresh pool might form. i get very interest in that sort of thing. it s not duty but it s what i m put here for. and then he begin to talk of his troop a i have hear his brother in india talk. such a troop. build up carefully and watch lovingly. not a man that i d wish to exchange and what s more i believe not a man that would wish to leave on his own account. we re different i believe from the english. your officer value the horse. we set store on the men. we train them more than we do the horse. 
of the american trooper i will tell you more hereafter. he be not a gentleman to be trifle with. 
next dawn enter a buggy of fragile construction with the old people from chicago i embark on my perilous career. we run straight up a mountain till we could see sixty mile away the white house of cook city on another mountain and the whiplash like trail lead thereto. the live air make me drink. if tom the driver have propose to send the mare in a bee line to the city i should have assent and so would the old lady who chew gum and talk about her symptom. the tub end rock dog which be but the translate prairie dog break across the road under our horse foot the rabbit and the chipmunk dance with fright. we hear the roar of the river and the road go round a corner. on one side pile rock and shale that enjoin silence for fear of a general slide down. on the other a sheer drop and a fool of a noisy river below. then apparently in the middle of the road l any should find drive too easy a post of rock. nothing beyond that save the flank of a cliff. then my stomach depart from me a it doe when you swing for we leave the dirt which be at least some guarantee of safety and sail out round the curve and up a steep incline on a plank road build out from the cliff. the plank be nail at the out edge and do not shift or creak very much but enough quite enough. that be the golden gate. i get my stomach back again when we trot out on to a vast upland adorn with a lake and hill. have you ever see an untouched land the face of virgin nature. it be rather a curious sight because the hill be choke with timber that ha never know an axe and the storm ha rent a way through this timber so that a hundred thousand tree lie mat together in swathe. and since each tree lie where it fall you may behold trunk and branch return to the earth whence they spring exactly a the body of man return each limb make it own little grave the grass climb above the bark till at last there remain only the outline of a tree upon the rank undergrowth. 
then we drive under a cliff of obsidian which be black glass some two hundred foot high. and the road at it foot be make of black glass that crackle. this be no great matter because half an hour before tom have pull up in the wood that we might sufficiently admire a mountain who stand all by himself shake with laughter or rage. 
the glass cliff overlook a lake where the beaver build a dam about a mile and a half long in a zig zag line a their necessity prompt. then come the government and strictly preserve them and a you shall learn late on they be damn impudent beast. the old lady have hardly explain the natural history of beaver before we climb some hill it really didn t matter in that climate because we could have scale the star and. this matter very much indeed. shoot down a desperate dusty slope brake shriek on the wheel the mare click among unseen rock the dust dense a a fog and a wall of tree on either side. how do the heavy four horse coach take it tom. i ask remember that some twenty three soul have go that way half an hour before. take it at the run. say tom spit out the dust. of course there be a sharp curve and a bridge at the bottom but luckily nothing meet u and we come to a wooden shanty call an hotel in time for a crazy tiffin serve by very gorgeous handmaid with very pink cheek. when health fail in other and more excite pursuit a season a help in one of the yellowstone hotel will restore the frail constitution. 
then by company after tiffin we walk chatter to the upland of hell. they call it the norris geyser basin on earth. it be a though the tide of desolation have go out but would presently return across innumerable acre of dazzle white geyser formation. there be no terrace here but all other horror. not ten yard from the road a blast of steam shoot up roar every few second a mud volcano spat filth to heaven stream of hot water rumble under foot plunge through the dead pine in steam cataract and die on a waste of white where green grey black yellow and pink pool roar shout bubble or hiss a their wicked fancy prompt. by the look of the eye the place should have be freeze over. by the feel of the foot it be warm. i venture out among the pool carefully follow track but one unwary foot begin to sink a squirt of water follow and have no desire to descend quick into tophet i return to the shore where the mud and the sulphur and the nameless fat ooze vegetation of lethe lay. but the very road ring a though build over a gulf. and besides how be i to tell when the rave blast of steam would find it vent insufficient and blow the whole affair into nirvana. there be a potent stench of stale egg everywhere and crystal of sulphur crumble under the foot and the glare of the sun on the white stuff be blind. sit under a bank to me appear a young trooper ex cape mount rifle this man. the real american seem to object to his army mount on a horse half madden by the noise and steam and smell. he carry only the six shooter and cartridge belt. on service the springfield carbine. which be clumsy. and a cartridge belt sling diagonally complete equipment. the sword be no earthly use for border warfare and except at state parade be never wear. the saddle be the mcclellan tree over a four fold blanket. sweat leather you must pay for yourself. and the beauty of the tree be that it necessitate first very careful girth and a thorough knowledge of trick with the blanket to suit the vary condition of the horse a broncho will bloat in a night if he can get at a bellyful and secondly even more careful rid to prevent gall. crupper and breast band do not seem to be use but they be casual about their accoutrement and the bite be the single jaw break curb which american war picture show u. that young man be very handsome and the grey service hat most like the under half of a seedy terai shade his strong face admirably a his horse back and shiver and sidle and plunge all over the road and he lecture from his saddle one foot out of the heavy hood stirrup one hand on the sweat neck. he s not use to the park this brute and he s a confirm bolter on parade. but we understand each other. whoosh. go the steam blast down the road with a dry roar. round spin the troop horse prepare to bolt and his momentum be suddenly check rear till i think he would fall back on his rider. oh no. we ve settle that little matter when i be break him say centaur. he use to try to fall back on me. isn t he a devil. i think you d laugh to see the way our regiment be horse. sometimes a big montana beast like mine ha a thirteen two broncho pony for neighbour and it s annoy if you re use to good thing. and oh how you have to ride your mount. it s necessary. but i can tell you at the end of a long day s march when you d give all the world to ride like a sack it isn t sweet to get extra drill for slouch. when we re turn out we re turn out for anything not a fifteen mile trot but for the use and behoof of all the northern state. i ve be in arizona. a trooper there who have be in india tell me that arizona be like afghanistan. there s nothing under heaven there except horn toad and rattlesnake and indian. our trouble be that we only deal with indian and they don t teach u much and of course the citizen look down on u and all that. a a matter of fact i suppose we re really only mount infantry but remember we re the best mount infantry in the world. and the horse dance a fandango in proof. 
my faith. say i look at the dusty blouse grey hat soil leather accoutrement and whalebone poise of the wearer. if they be all like you you be. 
thank whoever you may be. of course if we be turn into a lawn tennis court and tell to resist say your heavy cavalry we d be ride off the face of the earth if we couldn t get away. we have neither the weight nor the drill for a charge. my horse for instance by english standard be half break and like all the others he bolt when we re in line. but cavalry charge against cavalry charge doesn t happen often and if it do well all our men know that up to a hundred yard they be absolutely safe behind this old thing. he pat his revolver pouch. absolutely safe from any shoot of yours. what man do you think would dare to use a pistol at even thirty yard if his life depend oh it. not one of your men. they can t shoot. we can. you ll hear about that down the park further up. 
then he add courteously. just now it seem that the english supply all the men to the american army. that s what make them so good perhaps. and with mutual expression of good will we part he to an outlying patrol fifteen mile away i to my buggy and the old lady who regard the horror of the fire hole could only say good lord. at thirty second interval. her husband talk about dreffel waste of steam power and we go on in the clear crisp afternoon speculate a to the formation of geyser. 
what i say shriek the old lady apropos of matter theological and what i say more after have see all that be that the lord ha ordain a hell for such a disbelieve his gracious work. 
nota bene. tom have profanely curse the near mare for stumble. he look straight in front of him and say no word but the leave corner of his leave eye flicker in my direction. 
and if continue the old lady if we find a thing so dreffel a all that steam and sulphur allow on the face of the earth musn t we believe that there be something ten thousand time more terrible below prepare un_toe our destruction. 
some people have a wonderful knack of extract comfort from thing. i be ashamed to say i agree ostentatiously with the old lady. she develop the personal view of the matter. 
_now i shall be able to say something to anna fincher about her way of live. shan t i blake. this to her husband. 
yes say he speak slowly after a heavy tiffin. but the girl s a good girl. and they fell to argue a to whether the luckless anna fincher really stand in need of lecture edge with hell fire. she go to dance i believe. while i get out and walk in the dust alongside of tom. 
i drive blame cur ous kind folk through this place say he. blame cur ous. seem a pity that they should ha come so far just to liken norris basin to hell. guess chicago would ha serve em speak in comparison jest a good. 
we curve the hill and enter a forest of spruce the path serpentining between the tree bole the wheel run silent on immemorial mould. there be nothing alive in the forest save ourselves. only a river be speak angrily somewhere to the right. for mile we drive till tom bid u alight and look at certain fall. wherefore we step out of that forest and nearly fell down a cliff which guard a tumble river and return demand fresh miracle. if the water have run uphill we should perhaps have take more notice of it. but twas only a waterfall and i really forget whether the water be warm or cold. there be a stream here call firehole river. it be feed by the overflow from the various geyser and basin a warm and deadly river wherein no fish breed. i think we cross it a few dozen time in the course of a day. 
then the sun begin to sink and there be a taste of frost about and we go swiftly from the forest into the open dash across a branch of the firehole river and find a wood shanty even rough than the last at which after a forty mile drive we be to dine and sleep. half a mile from this place stand on the bank of the firehole river a beaver lodge and there be rumour of bear and other cheerful monster in the wood on the hill at the back of the build. 
in the cool crisp quiet of the even i seek that river and find a pile of newly gnaw stick and twig. the beaver work with the cold chisel and a few clean stroke suffice to level a four inch bole. across the water on the far bank glimmer with the ghastly white of peel dead timber the beaver lodge a mass of dishevel branch. the inhabitant have dam the stream low down and spread it into a nice little lake. the question be would they come out for their walk before it get too dark to see. they come blessing on their blunt muzzle they come a shadow come drift down the stream stir neither foot nor tail. there be three of them. one go down to investigate the state of the dam. the other two begin to look for supper. there be only one thing more startle than the noiselessness of a tiger in the jungle and that be the noiselessness of a beaver in the water. the strain ear could catch no sound whatever till they begin to eat the thick green river scudge that they call beaver grass. i bow among the log hold my breath and star with all my eye. they be not ten yard from me and they would have eat their dinner in peace so long a i have keep absolutely still. they be dear and desirable beast and i be just prepare to creep a step near when that wicked old lady from chicago clatter down the bank an umbrella in her hand shriek. beaver beaver. young man whurr be those beaver. good lord. what be that now. 
the solitary watcher might have hear a pistol shoot ring through the air. i wish it have kill the old lady but it be only the beaver give warn of danger with the slap of his tail on the water. it be exactly like the phink of a pistol fire with damp powder. then there be no more beaver not a whisker end. the lodge however be there and a beast low than any beaver begin to throw stone at it because the old lady from chicago say. p rap if you rattle them up they ll come out. i do so want to see a beaver. 
yet it cheer me to think i have see the beaver in his wild. never will i go to the zoo. that even after supper twere flattery to call it dinner a captain and a subaltern of the cavalry post appear at the hotel. these be the officer of whom the mammoth spring captain have speak. the lieutenant have read everything that he could lay hand on about the indian army especially our cavalry arrangement and be very full of a scheme for raise the rid red indian it be not every noble savage that will make a trooper into frontier levy a sort of khyber guard. only a he say ruefully there be no frontier these day and all our indian war be nearly over. those beautiful beast will die out and nobody will ever know what splendid cavalry they can make. 
the captain tell story of border warfare of ambush fire on the rear guard heat that split the skull good than any tomahawk cold that wrinkle the very liver night stampede of baggage mule raid of cattle and hopeless stern chase into inhospitable hill when the cavalry know that they be not only be outpace but outspied. then he speak of one fair charge when a tribe give battle in the open and the trooper ride in swordless fire right and leave with their revolver and it be excessively uncomfy for that tribe. and i speak of what men have tell me of hunting in burma of hill climb in the black mountain affair and so forth. 
exactly. say the captain. nobody know and nobody care. what doe it matter to the down easter who wrap up his tail be. 
and what doe the fat briton know or care about boh hla oo. say i. then both together. depend upon it my dear sir the army in both anglo saxon country be a mischievously underestimate institution and it s a pleasure to meet a man who etc. etc. and we nod triangularly in all good will and swear eternal friendship. the lieutenant make a statement which rather amaze me. he say that on account of the scarcity of business many american officer be to be find get practical instruction from little trouble among the south american republic. when the need break out they would return. there be so little for u to do and the republic ha a trick of make u hedge and ditch for our pay. a little road make on service be not a bad thing but continuous navvying be enough to knock the heart out of any army. 
i agree and we sit up till two in the morning swap the lie of east and west. a that glorious chief man afraid of pink rat once say to the agent on the reservation. melican officer good man. heap good man. drink me. drink he. drink me. drink he. drink he. me blind. heap good man. 
no. xxxi. 
end with the ca√±on of the yellowstone. the maiden from new hampshire larry wrap up his tail tom the old lady from chicago and a few natural phenomenon include one briton. 
what man would read and read the selfsame face and like the marble which the windmill grind rub smooth forever with the same smooth mind this year retrace last year s every year s dull trace when there be wood and unmanstifled place. lowell. 
once upon a time there be a carter who bring his team and a friend into the yellowstone park without due think. presently they come upon a few of the natural beauty of the place and that carter turn his team into his friend s team howl. get back o this jim. all hell s alight under our nose. and they call the place hell s half acre to this day. we too the old lady from chicago her husband tom and the good little mare come to hell s half acre which be about sixty acre and when tom say. would you like to drive over it. we say. certainly no and if you do we shall report you to the authority. there be a plain blister and peel and abominable and it be give over to the sport and spout of devil who throw mud and steam and dirt at each other with whoop and halloo and bellow curse. the place smelt of the refuse of the pit and that odour mix with the clean wholesome aroma of the pine in our nostril throughout the day. be it know that the park be lay out like ollendorf in exercise of progressive difficulty. hell s half acre be a prelude to ten or twelve mile of geyser formation. we pass hot stream boil in the forest. saw whiff of steam beyond these and yet other whiff break through the misty green hill in the far distance. we trample on sulphur and sniff thing much bad than any sulphur which be know to the upper world. and so come upon a park like place where tom suggest we should get out and play with the geyser. 
imagine mighty green field splatter with lime bed. all the flower of the summer grow up to the very edge of the lime. that be the first glimpse of the geyser basin. the buggy have pull up close to a rough break blister cone of stuff between ten and twenty foot high. there be trouble in that place moan splash gurgle and the clank of machinery. a spurt of boil water jump into the air and a wash of water follow. i remove swiftly. the old lady from chicago shriek. what a wicked waste. say her husband. i think they call it the riverside geyser. it spout be tear and rag like the mouth of a gun when a shell ha burst there. it grumble madly for a moment or two and then be still. i creep over the steam lime it be the burn marl on which satan lay and look fearfully down it mouth. you should never look a gift geyser in the mouth. i behold a horrible slippery slimy funnel with water rise and fall ten foot at a time. then the water rise to lip level with a rush and an infernal bubble trouble this devil s bethesda before the sullen heave of the crest of a wave lap over the edge and make me run. mark the nature of the human soul. i have begin with awe not to say terror. i step back from the flank of the riverside geyser say. pooh. be that all it can do. yet for aught i know the whole thing might have blow up at a minute s notice. she he or it be an arrangement of uncertain temper. 
we drift on up that miraculous valley. on either side of u be hill from a thousand to fifteen hundred foot high and wooded from heel to crest. a far a the eye could range forward be column of steam in the air misshapen lump of lime most like preadamite monster still pool of turquoise blue stretch of blue cornflower a river that coil on itself twenty time boulder of strange colour and ridge of glare star white. 
the old lady from chicago poke with her parasol at the pool a though they have be alive. on one particularly innocent look little puddle she turn her back for a moment and there rise behind her a twenty foot column of water and steam. then she shriek and protest that she never think it would ha do it and the old man chew his tobacco steadily and mourn for steam power waste. i embrace the whiten stump of a middle size pine that have grow all too close to a hot pool s lip and the whole thing turn over under my hand a a tree would do in a nightmare. from right and leave come the trumpet of elephant at play. i step into a pool of old dry blood rim with the nod cornflower. the blood change to ink even a i tread. and ink and blood be wash away in a spurt of boil sulphurous water spat out from the lee of a bank of flower. this sound mad doesn t it. 
a moonfaced trooper of german extraction never be park so carefully patrol come up to inform u that a yet we have not see any of the real geyser that they be all a mile or so up the valley tastefully scatter round the hotel in which we would rest for the night. america be a free country but the citizen look down on the soldier. i have to entertain that trooper. the old lady from chicago would have none of him. so we loaf along together now across half rotten pine log sink in swampy grind anon over the ring geyser formation then knee deep through long grass. 
and why do you list. say i. 
the moonfaced one s face begin to work. i think he would have a fit but he tell me a story instead such a nice tale of a naughty little girl who write love letter to two men at once. she be a simple village wife but a wicked family novelette count couldn t have accomplish her end good. she drive one man nearly wild with her pretty little treachery. and the other man abandon her and come west to forget. moonface be that man. 
we round a low spur of hill and come out upon a field of ache snowy lime roll in sheet twist into knot rive with rent and diamond and star stretch for more than half a mile in every direction. in this place of despair lay most of the big geyser who know when there be trouble in krakatoa who tell the pine when there be a cyclone on the atlantic seaboard and who be exhibit to visitor under pretty and fanciful name. the first mound that i encounter belong to a goblin splash in his tub. i hear him kick pull a shower bath on his shoulder gasp crack his joint and rub himself down with a towel. then he let the water out of the bath a a thoughtful man should and it all sink down out of sight till another goblin arrive. yet they call this place the lioness and the cub. it lie not very far from the lion which be a sullen roar beast and they say that when it be very active the other geyser presently follow suit. after the krakatoa eruption all the geyser go mad together spout spurt and bellow till men fear that they would rip up the whole field. mysterious sympathy exist among them and when the giantess speak. of her more anon. they all hold their peace. 
i be watch a solitary spring when far across the field stand up a plume of spin glass iridescent and superb against the sky. that say the trooper be old faithful. he go off every sixty five minute to the minute play for five minute and send up a column of water a hundred and fifty foot high. by the time you have look at all the other geyser he will be ready to play. 
so we look and we wonder at the beehive whose mouth be build up exactly like a hive. at the turban. which be not in the least like a turban. and at many many other geyser hot hole and spring. some of them rumble some hiss some go off spasmodically and others lay still in sheet of sapphire and beryl. 
would you believe that even these terrible creature have to be guard by the trooper to prevent the irreverent american from chip the cone to piece or bad still make the geyser sick. if you take of soft soap a small barrelful and drop it down a geyser s mouth that geyser will presently be force to lay all before you and for day afterwards will be of an irritate and inconsistent stomach. when they tell me the tale i be fill with sympathy. now i wish that i have steal soap and try the experiment on some lonely little beast of a geyser in the wood. it sound so probable and so human. 
yet he would be a bold man who would administer emetic to the giantess. she be flat lipped have no mouth she look like a pool fifty foot long and thirty wide and there be no ornamentation about her. at irregular interval she speak and send up a column of water over two hundred foot high to begin with. then she be angry for a day and a half sometimes for two day. owe to her peculiarity of go mad in the night not many people have see the giantess at her fine. but the clamour of her unrest men say shake the wooden hotel and echo like thunder among the hill. when i saw her trouble be brew. the pool bubble seriously and at five minute interval sink a foot or two then rise wash over the rim and huge steam bubble break on the top. just before an eruption the water entirely disappear from view. whenever you see the water die down in a geyser mouth get away a fast a you can. i saw a tiny little geyser suck in it breath in this way and instinct make me retire while it hoot after me. 
leave the giantess to swear and spit and thresh about we go over to old faithful who by reason of his faithfulness ha bench close to him whence you may comfortably watch. at the appoint hour we hear the water fly up and down the mouth with the sob of wave in a cave. then come the preliminary gout then a roar and a rush and that glitter column of diamond rise quiver stand still for a minute. then it break and the rest be a confuse snarl of water not thirty foot high. all the young lady not more than twenty in the tourist band remark that it be elegant and betook themselves to write their name in the bottom of shallow pool. nature fix the insult indelibly and the after year will learn that hattie sadie mamie sophie and so forth have take out their hair pin and scrawl on the face of old faithful. 
the congregation return to the hotel to put down their impression in diary and note book which they write up ostentatiously in the verandah. it be a swelter hot day albeit we stand somewhat high than the summit of jakko and i leave that raw pine creak caravanserai for the cool shade of a clump of pine between whose trunk glimmer tent. a batch of trooper come down the road and fling themselves across country into their rough line. verily the melican cavalry man can ride though he keep his accoutrement pig and his horse cow fashion. 
i be free of that camp in five minute free to play with the heavy lumpy carbine to have the saddle strip and punch the horse knowingly in the rib. one of the men have be in the fight with wrap up his tail before allude to and he tell me how that great chief his horse s tail tie up in red calico swagger in front of the unite state cavalry challenge all to single combat. but he be slay and a few of his tribe with him. there s no use in an indian anyway conclude my friend. 
a couple of cowboy real cowboy not the buffalo bill article jingle through the camp amid a shower of mild chaff. they be on their way to cook city i fancy and i know that they never wash. but they be picturesque ruffian with long spur hood stirrup slouch hat fur weather cloth over their knee and pistol butt easy to hand. 
the cowboy s goin under before long say my friend. soon a the country s settle up he ll have to go. but he s mighty useful now. what should we do without the cowboy. 
a how. say i and the camp laugh. 
he ha the money. we have the know how. he come in in winter to play poker at the military post. we play poker a few. when he s lose his money we make him drink and let him go. sometimes we get the wrong man. and he tell a tale of an innocent cowboy who turn up clean out at a post and play poker for thirty six hour. but it be the post that be clean out when that long haired caucasian ah sin remove himself heavy with everybody s pay and decline the proffer liquor. naow say the historian i don t play with no cowboy unless he s a little bite drink first. 
ere i depart i gather from more than one man that significant fact that up to one hundred yard he felt absolutely secure behind his revolver. 
in england i understand quoth a limber youth from the south in england a man aren t allow to play with no firearm. he s get to be teach all that when he enlist. i didn t want much teach how to shoot straight fore i serve uncle sam. and that s just where it be. but you be talk about your horse guard now. 
i explain briefly some peculiarity of equipment connect with our crack crack cavalry. i grieve to say the camp roar. 
take em over swampy grind. let em run around a bite an work the starch out of em an then almighty if we wouldn t plug em at ease i d eat their horse. 
but suppose they engage in the open. say i. 
engage the hades. not if there be a tree trunk within twenty mile they couldn t engage in the open. 
gentleman the officer have you ever seriously consider the existence on earth of a cavalry who by preference would fight in timber. the evident sincerity of the proposition make me think hard a i move over to the hotel and join a party exploration which dive into the wood unearth a pit pool of burning water fringe with jet black sand all the grind near by be pure white. but miracle pall when they arrive at the rate of twenty a day. a flame dragonfly fly over the pool reel and drop on the water die without a quiver of his gorgeous wing and the pool say nothing whatever but send it thin steam wreath up to the burn sky. i prefer pool that talk. 
there be a maiden a very trim maiden who have just step out of one of mr. jam s novel. she own a delightful mother and an equally delightful father a heavy eye slow voice man of finance. the parent think that their daughter want change. she live in new hampshire. accordingly she have drag them up to alaska to the yosemite valley and be now return leisurely via the yellowstone just in time for the tail end of the summer season at saratoga. we have meet once or twice before in the park and i have be amaze and amuse at her critical commendation of the wonder that she saw. from that very resolute little mouth i receive a lecture on american literature the nature and inwardness of washington society the precise value of cable s work a compare with uncle remus harris and a few other thing that have nothing whatever to do with geyser but be altogether delightful. now an english maiden who have stumble on a dust grime lime wash sun peel collarless wanderer come from and go to goodness know where would her mother incite her and her father brandish his umbrella have regard him a a dissolute adventurer. not so those delightful people from new hampshire. they be good enough to treat me it sound almost incredible a a human be possibly respectable probably not in immediate need of financial assistance. papa talk pleasantly and to the point. the little maiden strive valiantly with the accent of her birth and that of her read and mamma smile benignly in the background. 
balance this with a story of a young english idiot i meet knock about inside his high collar attend by a valet. he condescend to tell me that you can t be too careful who you talk to in these part and stalk on fear i suppose every minute for his social chastity. now that man be a barbarian. i take occasion to tell him so. for he comport himself after the manner of the head hunter of assam who be at perpetual feud one with another. 
you will understand that these foolish tale be introduce in order to cover the fact that this pen cannot describe the glory of the upper geyser basin. the even i spend under the lee of the castle geyser sit on a log with some trooper and watch a baronial keep forty foot high spout hot water. if the castle go off first they say the giantess would be quiet and vice versa. and then they tell tale till the moon get up and a party of camper in the wood give u all something to eat. 
next morning tom drive u on promise new wonder. he pull up after a few mile at a clump of brushwood where an army be drown. i could hear the sick gasp and thump of the men go under but when i break through the brushwood the host have flee and there be only pool of pink black and white lime thick a turbid honey. they shoot up a pat of mud every minute or two choke in the effort. it be an uncanny sight. do you wonder that in the old day the indian be careful to avoid the yellowstone. geyser be permissible but mud be terrify. the old lady from chicago take a piece of it and in half an hour it die into lime dust and blow away between her finger. all maya_ illusion you see. then we clink over sulphur in crystal. there be a waterfall of boil water. and a road across a level park hotly contest by the beaver. every winter they build their dam and flood the low lie land. every summer that dam be tear up by the government and for half a mile you must plough axle deep in water the willow brush into the buggy and little waterway branch off right and leave. the road be the main stream just like the bolan line in flood. if you turn up a byway there be no more of you and the beaver work your buggy into next year s dam. 
then come soft turfy forest that deaden the wheel and two trooper on detachment duty come noiselessly behind u. one be the wrap up his tail man and we talk merrily while the half break horse buck about among the tree till we come to a mighty hill all strew with moss agate and everybody have to get out and pant in that thin air. but how intoxicate it be. the old lady from chicago cluck like an emancipate hen a she scuttle about the road cram piece of rock into her reticule. she send me fifty yard down the hill to pick up a piece of break bottle which she insist be moss agate. i ve some o that at home an they shine. you go get it young feller. 
a we climb the long path the road grow vile and vile till it become without disguise the bed of a torrent. and just when thing be at their rocky we emerge into a little sapphire lake but never sapphire be so blue call mary s lake. and that between eight and nine thousand foot above the sea. then come grass down all on a vehement slope so that the buggy follow the new make road run on to the two off wheel mostly till we dip head first into a ford climb up a cliff race along a down dip again and pull up dishevel at larry s for lunch and an hour s rest. only larry could have manage that school feast tent on the lonely hillside. need i say that he be an irishman. his supply be at their low ebb but larry envelop u all in the golden glamour of his speech ere we have descend and the tent with the rude trestle table become a palace the rough fare delicacy of delmonico and we the abash recipient of larry s imperial bounty. it be only late that i discover i have pay eight shilling for tin beef biscuit and beer but on the other hand larry have say. will i go out an kill a buffalo. and i felt that for me and for me alone would he have do it. everybody else felt that way. good luck go with larry. 
an now you ll all go an wash your pocket handkerchief in that beautiful hot spring round the corner say he. there s soap an a washboard ready an ti not every day that ye can get hot water for nothing. he wave u large handedly to the open down while he put the tent to right. these be no sense of fatigue on the body or distance in the air. hill and dale ride on the eyeball. i could have clutch the far off snowy peak by put out my hand. never be such madden air. why we should have wash pocket handkerchief larry alone know. it appear to be a sort of religious rite. in a little valley overhang with gay paint rock run a stream of velvet brown and pink. it be hot hot than the hand could bear and it colour the boulder in it course. 
there be the maiden from new hampshire the old lady from chicago papa mamma the woman who chew gum and all the rest of them gravely bend over a washboard and soap. mysterious virtue lay in that queer stream. it turn the linen white a drive snow in five minute and then we lay on the grass and laugh with sheer bliss of be alive. this have i know once in japan once on the bank of the columbia what time the salmon come in and california howl and once again in the yellowstone by the light of the eye of the maiden from new hampshire. four little pool lay at my elbow. one be of black water. tepid. one clear water. cold. one clear water. hot. one red water. boil. my newly wash handkerchief cover them all. we marvel a child marvel. 
this even we shall do the grand ca√±on of the yellowstone. say the maiden. 
together. say i. and she say yes. 
the sun be sink when we hear the roar of fall water and come to a broad river along whose bank we run. and then oh then. i might at a pinch describe the infernal region but not the other place. be it know to you that the yellowstone river ha occasion to run through a gorge about eight mile long. to get to the bottom of the gorge it make two leap one of about one hundred and twenty and the other of three hundred foot. i investigate the upper or less fall which be close to the hotel. up to that time nothing particular happen to the yellowstone it bank be only rocky rather steep and plentifully adorn with pine. at the fall it come round a corner green solid rib with a little foam and not more than thirty yard wide. then it go over still green and rather more solid than before. after a minute or two you sit upon a rock directly above the drop begin to understand that something ha occur. that the river ha jump a huge distance between solid cliff wall and what look like the gentle froth of ripple lap the side of the gorge below be really the outcome of great wave. and the river yell aloud. but the cliff do not allow the yell to escape. 
that inspection begin with curiosity and finish in terror for it seem that the whole world be slide in chrysolite from under my foot. i follow with the others round the corner to arrive at the brink of the ca√±on. we have to climb up a nearly perpendicular ascent to begin with for the grind rise more than the river drop. stately pine wood fringe either lip of the gorge which be the gorge of the yellowstone. 
all i can say be that without warn or preparation i look into a gulf seventeen hundred foot deep with eagle and fish hawk circle far below. and the side of that gulf be one wild welter of colour crimson emerald cobalt ochre amber honey splash with port wine snow white vermilion lemon and silver grey in wide wash. the side do not fall sheer but be grave by time and water and air into monstrous head of king dead chief men and woman of the old time. so far below that no sound of it strife could reach u the yellowstone river run a finger wide strip of jade green. the sunlight take those wondrous wall and give fresh hue to those that nature have already lay there. once i saw the dawn break over a lake in rajputana and the sun set over the oodey sagar amid a circle of holman hunt hill. this time i be watch both performance go on below me upside down you understand and the colour be real. the ca√±on be burn like troy town. but it would burn for ever and thank goodness neither pen nor brush could ever portray it splendour adequately. the academy would reject the picture for a chromolithograph. the public would scoff at the letter press for daily telegraphese. i will leave this thing alone say i. ti my peculiar property. nobody else shall share it with me. even creep through the pine that shadow u but the full glory of the day flame in that ca√±on a we go out very cautiously to a jut piece of rock blood red or pink it be that overhang the deep deep of all. now i know what it be to sit enthrone amid the cloud of sunset. giddiness take away all sensation of touch or form. but the sense of blind colour remain. when i reach the mainland again i have swear that i have be float. the maid from new hampshire say no word for a very long time. she then quote poetry which be perhaps the best thing she could have do. 
and to think that this show place ha be go on all these day an none of we ever saw it say the old lady from chicago with an acid glance at her husband. 
no only the injun say he unmoved. and the maiden and i laugh long. inspiration be fleet beauty be vain and the power of the mind for wonder limit. though the shin host themselves have rise choir from the bottom of the gorge they would not have prevent her papa and one base than himself from roll stone down those stupendous rainbow wash slide. seventeen hundred foot of steep pitch and rather more than seventeen hundred colour for log or boulder to whirl through. so we heave thing and saw them gather way and bind from white rock to red or yellow drag behind them torrent of colour till the noise of their descent cease and they bound a hundred yard clear at the last into the yellowstone. 
i ve be down there say tom that even. it s easy to get down if you re careful just sit and slide. but get up be bad. an i find down below there two rock just mark with a picture of the ca√±on. i wouldn t sell those rock not for fifteen dollar. 
and papa and i crawl down to the yellowstone just above the first little fall to wet a line for good luck. the round moon come up and turn the cliff and pine into silver. a two pound trout come up also and we slew him among the rock nearly tumble into that wild river. 
* * * * *. 
then out and away to livingstone once more. the maiden from new hampshire disappear. papa and mamma with her disappear. disappear too the old lady from chicago and all the rest while i think of all that i have not see the forest of petrify tree with amethyst crystal in their black heart. the great yellowstone lake where you catch your trout alive in one spring and drop him into another to boil him. and most of all of that mysterious hoodoo region where all the devil not employ in the geyser live and kill the wander bear and elk so that the scar hunter find in death gulch pile carcass of the dead whom no man ha smite. hoodoo land with the overhead noise the bird and beast and devil rock the maze and the bottomless pit all these thing i miss. on the return road yankee jim and diana of the crossway give me kindly greet a the train pause an instant before their door and at livingstone whom should i see but tom the driver. 
i ve do with the yellowstone and decide to clear out east somewhere say he. your talkin about movin round so gay an careless make me kind restless. i m movin out. 
lord forgie u for our responsibility one to another. 
and your partner. say i. 
here s him say tom introduce a gawky youth with a bundle. and i saw those two young men turn their face to the east. 
no. xxxii. 
of the american army and the city of the saint. the temple the book of mormon and the girl from dorset. an oriental consideration of polygamy. 
a fool also be full of word. a man cannot tell what shall be. and what shall be after him who can tell. 
it ha just occur to me with great force that delightful a these letter be to myself their length and breadth and depth may be just the least little bite in the world wearisome to you over there. i will compress myself rigorously though i should very much like to deliver a dissertation on the american army and the possibility of it extension. 
the american army be a beautiful little army. some day when all the indian be happily dead or drink it ought to make the fine scientific and survey corp that the world ha ever see. it doe excellent work now but there be this defect in it nature. it be officer a you know from west point but the mischief of it be that west point seem to be create for the purpose of spread a general knowledge of military matter among the people. a boy go up to that institution get his pas and return to civil life so they tell me with a dangerous knowledge that he be a suck moltke and may apply his learn when occasion offer. give trouble that man will be a nuisance because he be a hideously versatile american to begin with a cocksure of himself a a man can be and with all the racial disregard for human life to back him through his demi semi professional generalship. in a country where a the record of the daily paper show men engage in a conflict with police or jail be all too ready to adopt a military formation and get heavily shoot in a sort of cheap half instruct warfare instead of be decently scar by the appearance of the military this sort of arrangement doe not seem wise. the bond between the state be of amaze tenuity. so long a they do not absolutely march into the district of columbia sit on the washington statue and invent a flag of their own they can legislate lynch hunt negro through swamp divorce railroad and rampage a much a ever they choose. they do not need knowledge of their own military strength to back their genial lawlessness. that regular army which be a dear little army should be keep to itself blood on detachment duty turn into the path of science and now and again assemble at feast of freemason and so forth. it s too tiny to be a political power. the immortal wreck of the grand army of the republic be a political power of the large and most unblushing description. it ought not to help to lay the foundation of an amateur military power that be blind and irresponsible. 
be thankful that the balance of this lecture be suppress and with it the account of a shiveree which i attend in livingstone city. and the story of the editor and the sub editor. the latter be a pet cougar or mountain lion who use they say skilfully to sub edit disputant in the office. of the livingstone daily paper. 
omit a thousand matter of first importance let me pick up the thread of thing on a narrow gauge line that take me down to salt lake. the run between delhi and ahmedabad on a may day would have be bliss compare to this torture. there be nothing but glare and desert and alkali dust. there be no smoke accommodation. i sit in the lavatory with the conductor and a prospector who tell story about indian atrocity in the voice of a dream child oath follow oath a smoothly a clot cream lap the mouth of the jug. i don t think he know he be say anything out of the way but nine or ten of those oath be new to me and one even make the conductor raise his eyebrow. 
and when a man s alone mostly leadin his horse across the hill he get to talk aloud to himself a it be say the weather wear retailer of torture. a vision rise before me of this man trample the bannack city trail under the star swear always swear. 
bundle of rag that be point out a red indian board the train from time to time. their race privilege allow them free transit on the platform of the car. they mustn t come inside of course and equally of course the train never think of pull up for them. i saw a squaw take u fly and leave u in the same manner when we be spin round a curve. like the punjabi the red indian get out by preference on the trackless plain and walk stolidly to the horizon. he never say where he be go. 
salt lake. i be concern for the sake of mr. phil robinson his soul. you will remember that he write a book call saint and sinner in which he prove very prettily that the mormon be almost altogether an estimable person. ever since my arrival at salt lake i have be wonder what make him write that book. on mature reflection and after a long walk round the city i be incline to think it be the sun which be very powerful hereabouts. 
by great good luck the evil mind train already delay twelve hour by a burn bridge bring me to the city on a saturday by way of that valley which the mormon aver their effort have cause to blossom like the rise. some hour previously i have enter a new world where in conversation every one be either a mormon or a gentile. it be not seemly for a free and independent citizen to dub himself a gentile but the mayor of ogden which be the gentile city of the valley tell me that there must be some distinction between the two flock. long before the fruit orchard of logan or the shin level of the salt lake have be reach that mayor himself a gentile and one renowned for his dealing with the mormon tell me that the great question of the existence of the power within the power be be gradually solve by the ballot and by education. we have quoth he hill round and about here stuff full of silver and gold and lead and all hell atop of the mormon church can t keep the gentile from flock in when that s the case. at ogden thirty mile from salt lake this year the gentile vote swamp the mormon at the municipal election and next year we trust that we shall be able to repeat our success in salt lake itself. in that city the gentile be only one third of the total population but the mass of em be grow men capable of vote. whereas the mormon be clutter up with child. i guess a soon a we have purely gentile officer in the township and the control of the policy of the city the mormon will have to back down considerable. they re bind to go before long. my own notion be that it s the old men who keep alive the opposition to the gentile and all his work. the young one spite of all the elder tell em will mix with the gentile and read gentile book and you bet your sweet life there s a holy influence work toward conversion in the kiss of an average gentile specially when the girl know that he win t think it necessary for her salvation to load the house up with other woman folk. i guess the young generation be give sore trouble to the elder. what s that you say about polygamy. it s a penal offence now under a bill pass not long ago. the mormon ha to elect one wife and keep to her. if he s catch visit any of the others do you see that cool and restful brown stone build way over there against the hillside. that s the penitentiary. he be send there to consider his sin and he pay a fine too. but most of the police in salt lake be mormon and i don t suppose they be too hard on their friend. i presoom there s a good deal of polygamy practise on the sly. but the chief trouble be to get the mormon to see that the gentile isn t the doubly damn beast that the elder represent. only get the gentile well into the state and the whole concern be bind to go to piece in a very little time. 
and the wish be father to the think why certainly say i and begin to take in the valley of deseret the home of the latter day saint and the abide perhaps of a much misery a ha ever be compress into forty year. the good folk at home will not understand but you will what follow. you know how in bengal to this day the child wife be teach to curse her possible co wife ere yet she ha go to her husband s house. and the bengali woman ha be accustom to polygamy for a few hundred year. you know too the awful jealousy between mother wife and barren behind the purdah the jealousy that culminate sometimes in the poison of the well beloved son. now and again an englishwoman employ a high caste mussulman nurse and in the office of that hire woman be apt to forget the difference of colour and to speak unreservedly a twin daughter under eve s curse. the nurse tell very strange and awful thing. she ha and this the mormon count a privilege be bear into polygamy. but she loathe and detest it from the bottom of her jealous soul. and to the lot of the bengali co wife the curse of the curse the daughter of the dunghill the scald head and the barren mute. you know the rest of that sweet commination service. one creed of all the white creed to day deliberately introduce the white woman take from century of train which have teach her that it be right to control the undivided heart of one man. to quench her most natural rebellion that amaze creed and fantastic jumble of mahometanism the mosaical law and imperfectly comprehend fragment of freemasonry call to it aid all the power of a hell conceive and elaborate by coarse mind hedger and ditchers. a sweet view isn t it. 
all the beauty of the valley could not make me forget it. but the valley be very fair. bench after bench of land flat a a table against the flank of the ring hill mark where the salt lake rest for a while a it sink from an inland sea to a lake fifty mile long and thirty broad. before long the bench will be cover with house. at present these be hide among the green tree on the dead flat of the valley. you have read a hundred time how the street of salt lake city be very broad furnish with row of shade tree and gutter of fresh water. this be true but i strike the town in a season of great drouth that same drouth which be play havoc with the herd of montana. the tree be limp and the rill of sparkle water that one read about be represent by dusty pave course. main street appear to be inhabit by the commercial gentile who ha make of it a busy bustle thoroughfare and in the eye of the sun swig the ungodly lager and smoke the improper cigar all day long. for which i like him. at the head of main street stand the lion of the place. the temple and the tabernacle the tithe house and the house of brigham young whose portrait be on sale in most of the bookseller shop. incidentally it may be mention that the late amir of utah doe not unremotely resemble his highness the amir of afghanistan whom these fortunate eye have see. and i have no desire to fall into the hand of the amir. the first thing to be see be of course the temple the outward exponent of a creed. arm with a copy of the book of mormon for good comprehension i go to form rash opinion. some day the temple will be finish. it be begin only thirty year ago and up to date rather more than three million dollar and a half have be expend in it granite bulk. the wall be ten foot thick. the edifice itself be about a hundred foot high. and it tower will be nearly two hundred. and that be all there be of it unless you choose to inspect more closely. always read the book of mormon a you walk. then the wondrous puerility of what i suppose we must call the design become apparent. these men directly inspire from on high heap stone on stone and pillar on pillar without achieve either dignity relief or interest. there be over the main door some pitiful scratch in stone represent the all see eye the masonic grip the sun moon and star and perhaps other skittle. the flatness and meanness of the thing almost make you weep when you look at the magnificent granite in block strew abroad and think of the art that three million dollar might have call in to the aid of the church. it be a though a child have say. let u draw a great big fine house fine than any house that ever be and in that desire have laboriously smudge along with a ruler and pencil pile meaningless straight line on compass draw curve with his tongue follow every movement of the inept hand. then sit i down on a wheelbarrow and read the book of mormon and behold the spirit of the book be the spirit of the stone before me. the estimable joseph and hyrum smith struggle to create a new bible when they know nothing of the history of old and new testament and the inspire architect muddle with his brick they be brother. but the book be more interest than the build. it be write and all the world ha read how to joseph smith an angel come down from heaven with a pair of celestial gig lamp whereby he be marvellously enable to interpret certain plate of gold scribble over with dot and scratch and discover by him in the grind. which plate joseph smith do translate only he spell the mysterious character caractors and out of the dot and scratch produce a volume of six hundred closely print page contain the book of nephi first and second jacob enos jarom omni mormon mosiah the record of zeniff the book of alma helaman the third of nephi the book of ether. the whole thing be a powerful an√¶sthetic by the way. and the final book of mononi. three men of whom one i believe be now live bear solemn witness that the angel with the spectacle appear unto them. eight other men swear solemnly that they have see the golden plate of the revelation. and upon this testimony the book of mormon stand. the mormon bible begin at the day of zedekiah king of judah and end in a wild and welter quagmire of tribal fight bit of revelation and wholesale crib from the bible. very sincerely do i sympathise with the inspire brother a i wad through their joint production. a a humble fellow worker in the field of fiction i know what it be to get good name for one s character. but joseph and hyrum be hard bestead than ever i have be. and bold men to boot. they create teancum and coriantumy pakhoran kishkumen and gadianton and other priceless name which the memory doe not hold. but of geography they wisely steer clear and be astutely vague a to the locality of place because you see they be by no mean certain what lay in the next county to their own. they march and countermarch bloodthirsty army across their page. and add new and amaze chapter to the record of the new testament and reorganise the heaven and the earth a it be always lawful to do in print. but they could not achieve style and it be foolish of them to let into their weird mosaic piece of the genuine bible whenever the labour pen drop from it toilsome parody to a sentence or two of vile bad english or downright penny dreadfulism. and moses say unto the people of israel. great scott. what air you do. there be no sentence in the book of mormon word for word like the forego. but the general tone be not widely different. 
there be the making of a very fine creed about mormonism. to begin with the church be rather more absolute than that of rome. drop the polygamy plank in the platform but on the other hand deal lightly with certain form of excess. keep the quality of the recruit down to a low mental level and see that the best of the agricultural science available be in the hand of the elder and you have there a first class engine for pioneer work. the tawdry mysticism and the borrowing from freemasonry serve the low caste swede and the dane the welshman and the cornish cottar just a well a a highly organise heaven. 
i go about the street and peep into people s front window and the decoration upon the table be after the manner of the year. main street be full of country folk from the outside come in to trade with the zion mercantile co operative institute. the church i fancy look after the finance of this thing and it consequently pay good dividend. the face of the woman be not lovely. indeed but for the certainty that ugly person be just a irrational in the matter of undivided love a the beautiful it seem that polygamy be a bless institution for the woman and that only the spiritual power could drive the hulk board face men into it. the woman wear hideous garment and the men seem to be tie up with string. they would market all that afternoon and on sunday go to the pray place. i try to talk to a few of them but they speak strange tongue and star and behave like cow. yet one woman and not an altogether ugly one confide to me that she hat the idea of salt lake city be turn into a show place for the amusement of the gentile. 
if we ave our own institution that ain t no reason why people should come ere and stare at u his it. 
the drop h betray her. 
and when do you leave england. i say. 
summer of. i be from dorset she say. the mormon agent be very good to u and we be very poor. now we re good off my father an mother an me. 
then you like the state. 
she misunderstand at first. oh i ain t livin in the state of polygamy. not me yet. i ain t marry. i like where i be. i ve get thing o my own and some land. 
but i suppose you will. 
not me. i ain t like them swede an dane. i ain t get nothin to say for or against polygamy. it s the elder business an between you an me i don t think it s go on much long. you ll ear them in the ouse to morrer talkin a if it be spreadin all over america. the swede they think it his. i know it hisn t. 
but you ve get your land all right. 
oh yes we ve get our land an we never say aught against polygamy o course father an mother an me. 
it strike me that there be a fraud somewhere. you ve never hear of the rice christian have you. 
i should have like to have speak to the maiden at length but she dive into the zion co op. and a man capture me say that it be my bounden duty to see the sight of salt lake. these comprise the egg shape tabernacle the beehive and town house of brigham young. the same great ruffian s tomb with assort sample of his wife sleep round him. just a the eleven faithful one sleep round the ash of runjit singh outside fort lahore. and one or two other curiosity. but all these thing have be describe by able pen than mine. the animal house where brigham use to pack his wife be grubby villa. the tabernacle be a shingle fraud and the tithe house where all the revenue return seem to be make much resemble a stable. the mormon have a paper currency of their own ecclesiastical bank note which be exchange for local produce. but the little boy of the place prefer the bullion of the gentile. it be not pleasant to be take round a township with your guide stop before every third house to say. that s where elder so and so keep amelia bathershins his fifth wife no his third. amelia she be take on after keziah but keziah be the elder s pet an he didn t dare to let amelia come across keziah for fear of her spilin keziah s beauty. the mussulmans be quite right. the minute that all the domestic detail of polygamy be discuss in the mouth of the people that institution be ready to fall. i shake off my guide when he have tell me his very last doubtful tale and go on alone. an order peace and a perfection of quiet luxury be the note of the city of salt lake. the house stand in generous and well groom grass plot none very much bad or good than their neighbour. creeper grow over the house front and there be a very pleasant music of wind among the tree in the vast empty street bring a smell of hay and the flower of summer. 
on a tableland overlook all the city stand the unite state garrison of infantry and artillery. the state of utah can do nearly anything it plea until that much to be desire hour when the gentile vote shall quietly swamp out mormonism. but the garrison be keep there in case of accident. the big shark mouth pig eared heavy bone farmer sometimes take to their creed with wild fanaticism and in past year have make life excessively unpleasant for the gentile when he be few in the land. but to day so far from kill openly or secretly or burn gentile farm it be all the mormon dare do to feebly try to boycott the interloper. his journal preach defiance to the unite state government and in the tabernacle of a sunday the preacher follow suit. when i go down there the place be full of people who would have be much good for a wash. a man rise up and tell them that they be the choose of god the elect of israel that they be to obey their priest and that there be a good time come. i fancy that they have hear all this before so many time it produce no impression whatever. even a the sublime mystery of another faith lose salt through constant iteration. they breathe heavily through their nose and star straight in front of them impassive a flatfish. 
and that even i go up to the garrison post one of the most covet of all the army command and overlook the city of the saint a it lay in the circle of it forbid hill. you can speculate a good deal about the mass of human misery the love frustrate the gentle heart break and the strong soul twist from the law of life to a fierce follow of the law of death that the hill have see. how must it have be in the old day when the footsore emigrant break through into the circle and know that they be cut off from hope of return or sight of friend be hand over to the power of the friend that call themselves priest of the most high. but for the grace of god there go richard baxter a the eminent divine once say. it seem good that fate do not order me to be a brick in the up build of the mormon church that ha so aptly establish herself by the border of a lake bitter salt and hopeless. 
no. xxxiii. 
how i meet certain people of importance between salt lake and omaha. 
much have i see city and men. 
let there be no misunderstand about the matter. i love this people and if any contemptuous criticism ha to be do i will do it myself. my heart ha go out to them beyond all other people. and for the life of me i cannot tell why. they be bleed raw at the edge almost more conceited than the english vulgar with a massive vulgarity which be a though the pyramid be coat with christmas cake sugar work. cocksure they be lawless and a casual a they be cocksure. but i love them and i realise it when i meet an englishman who laugh at them. he prove conclusively that they be all wrong from their tariff to their go a you please civil service and beneath the consideration of a true briton. 
i admit everything say i. their government s provisional. their law s the notion of the moment. their railway be make of hair pin and match stick and most of their good luck life in their wood and mine and river and not in their brain. but for all that they be the big fine and best people on the surface of the globe. just you wait a hundred year and see how they ll behave when they ve have the screw put on them and have forget a few of the patriarchal teaching of the late mister george washington. wait till the anglo american german jew the man of the future be properly equip. he ll have just the least little kink in his hair now and again. he ll carry the english lung above the teuton foot that can walk for ever. and he will wave long thin bony yankee hand with the big blue vein on the wrist from one end of the earth to the other. he ll be the fine writer poet and dramatist specially dramatist that the world a it recollect itself ha ever see. by virtue of his jew blood just a little little drop he ll be a musician and a painter too. at present there be too much balcony and too little romeo in the life play of his fellow citizen. late on when the proportion be adjust and he see the possibility of his land he will produce thing that will make the effete east stare. he will also be a complex and highly composite administrator. there be nothing know to man that he will not be and his country will sway the world with one foot a a man tilt a see saw plank. 
but this be bad than the eagle at it bad. do you seriously believe all that. say the englishman. 
if i believe anything seriously all this i most firmly believe. you wait and see. sixty million people chiefly of english instinct who be train from youth to believe that nothing be impossible don t slink through the century like russian peasantry. they be bind to leave their mark somewhere and don t you forget it. 
but isn t it sad to think that with all eternity behind and before u we cannot even though we would pay for it with sorrow filch from the immensity one hundred poor year of life wherein to watch the two great experiment. a hundred year hence india and america will be worth observe. at present the one be burn out and the other be only just stoke up. when i leave my opponent there be much need for faith because i fell into the hand of a perfectly delightful man whom i have meet casually in the street sit in a chair on the pavement smoke a huge cigar. he be a commercial traveller and his beat lay through southern mexico and he tell me tale of forget city stone god up to their sacred eye in forest growth mexican priest rebellion and dictatorship that make my hair curl. it be he who drag me forth to bathe in salt lake which be some fifteen mile away from the city and reachable by many train which be but open tram car. the track like all american track be terrify in it roughness. and the end of the journey disclose the nakedness of the accommodation. there be pier and band house and refreshment stall build over the solid grey level of the lake but they only accentuate the utter barrenness of the place. american don t mix with their scenery a yet. 
and have faith say the commercial traveller a he walk into water heavy a quicksilver. walk. i walk and i walk till my leg fly up and i have to walk a one struggle with a high wind but still i ride head and shoulder above the water. it be a horrible feel this inability to sink. swim be not much use. you couldn t get a grip of the water so i e en sit me down and drift like a luxurious anemone among the hundred that be bath in that place. you could wallow for three quarter of an hour in that warm sticky brine and fear no evil consequence. but when you come out you be coat with white salt from top to toe. and if you accidentally swallow a mouthful of the water you die. this be true because i swallow half a mouthful and be half dead in consequence. 
the commercial traveller on our return journey across the level flat that fringe the lake s edge bid me note some of the custom of his people. the great open railway car hold about a hundred men and maiden come up with a song from the sea. they sing and they shout and they exchange witticism of the most poignant and comport themselves like their brother and sister over the sea the arries and arriets of the old world. and there sit behind me two modest maiden in white alone and unattended. to these the privilege youth of the car a youth of a marvellous range of voice proffer undying affection. they laugh but make no reply in word. the suit be renew and with extravagant imagery. the near seat applaud. when we arrive at the city the maiden turn and go their way up a dark tree shade street and the boy elsewhere. whereat recollect what the london rough be like i marvel that they do not pursue. it s all right say the commercial traveller. if they have follow well i guess some one would ha shoot em. the very next day on those very peaceful car return from the lake some one be shoot dead. he be what they call a sport which be american for a finish leg and he have an argument with a police officer and the latter slew him. i saw his funeral go down the main street. there be nearly thirty carriage fill with doubtful men and woman not in the least doubtful and the local paper say that decease have his merit but it didn t much matter because if the sheriff hadn t drop him he would assuredly have drop the sheriff. somehow this jar on my sensitive feeling and i go away though the commercial traveller would fain have entertain me in his own house he know not my name. twice through the long hot night we talk tilt up our chair on the sidewalk of the future of america. 
you should hear the saga of the state reel off by a young and enthusiastic citizen who have just carve out for himself a home fill it with a pretty little wife and be prepare to embark on commerce on his own account. i be tempt to believe that pistol shot be regrettable accident and lawlessness only the top scum on the great sea of humanity. i be tempt to believe that still though bake and dusty utah be very many mile behind me. 
then chance throw me into the arm of another and very different commercial traveller a we pull out of utah on our way to omaha via the rockies. he travel in biscuit of which more anon and fate have smite him very heavily have at one stroke knock all the beauty and joy out of his poor life. so he journey with a case of sample a one daze and his eye take no pleasure in anything that he saw. in his despair he have withdraw himself to his religion he be a baptist and speak of it consolation with the artless freedom that an american generally exhibit when he be talk about his most sacred private affair. there be a desert beyond utah hot and barren a mian mir in may. the sun bake the car roof and the dust cake the window and through the dust and the glare the man with the biscuit bore witness to his creed which seem to include one of the great miracle in the world the immediate unforeseen self conscious redemption of the soul by mean very similar to those which turn paul to the straight path. 
you must experi_ence religion he repeat his mouth twitch and his eye black ring with his recent loss. you must experi_ence religion. you can t tell when you re goin to get or haow. but it will come it will come sir like a lightning stroke an you will wrestle with yourself before you receive full conviction and assurance. 
how long doe that take. i ask reverently. 
it may take hour. it may take day. i know a man in san jo who lay under conviction for a month an then he get the sperrit a you must git it. 
and then. 
and then you be save. you feel that an you kin endure anything he sigh. yes anything. i don t care what it be though i allow that some thing be hard than others. 
then you have to wait for the miracle to be work by power outside yourself. and if the miracle doesn t work. 
but it must. i tell you it must. it come to all who profess with faith. 
i learn a good deal about that creed a the train flee on. and i wonder a i learn. it be a strange thing to watch that poor human soul break and bow by it loss nerve itself against each new pang of pain with the iterate assurance that it be safe against the pain of hell. 
the heat be stifle. we quit the desert and launch into the roll green plain of colorado. doze uneasily with every removable rag remove i be rouse by a blast of intense cold and the drum of a hundred drum. the train have stop. far a the eye could range the land be white under two foot of hail each hailstone a big a the top of a sherry glass. i saw a young colt by the side of the track stand with his poor little fluffy back to the pitiless pelt. he be pound to death. an old horse meet his doom on the run. he gallop wildly towards the train but his hind leg drop into a hole half water and half ice. he beat the grind with his fore foot for a minute and then roll over on his side submit quietly to be kill. 
when the storm cease we pick our way cautiously and crippledly over a track that might give way at any moment. the western driver urge his train much a doe the subaltern the bound pony and twould seem with an equal sense of responsibility. if a foot doe go wrong why there you be don t you know and if it be all right why all right it be don t you know. but i would sooner be on the pony than the train. 
this seem a good place wherein to preach on american versatility. when mr. howells write a novel when a reckless hero dam a flood by heave a dynamite shatter mountain into it or when a notoriety hunt preacher marry a couple in a balloon you shall hear the great american press rise on it hind leg and walk round mouth over the versatility of the american citizen. and he be versatile horribly so. the unlimited exercise of the right of private judgment. which by the way be a weapon not one man in ten be competent to handle. his blatant cocksureness and the dry air breed restlessness that make him crawl all over the furniture when he be talk to you conspire to make him versatile. but what he call versatility the impartial bystander of anglo indian extraction be apt to deem mere casualness and dangerous casualness at that. no man can grasp the inwardness of an employ by the light of pure reason even though that reason be republican. he must serve an apprenticeship to one craft and learn that craft all the day of his life if he wish to excel therein. otherwise he merely put the thing through somehow. and occasionally he doesn t. but wherein lie the beauty of this form of mental suppleness. old man california whom i shall love and respect always tell me one or two anecdote about american versatility and it consequence that come back to my mind with direful force a the train progress. we didn t upset but i don t think that that be the fault of the driver or the men who make the track. take up you can easily find them the account of ten consecutive railway catastrophe not little accident but first class fatality when the long car turn over take fire and roast the luckless occupant alive. to seven out of the ten you shall find append the cheerful statement. the accident be suppose to have be due to the rail spread. that mean the metal be spike down to the tie with such versatility that the spike or the track draw under the constant vibration of the traffic and the metal open out. no one be hang for these little affair. 
we begin to climb hill and then we stop at night in darkness while men throw sand under the wheel and crowbarred the track and then guess that we might proceed. not be in the least anxious to face my maker half asleep and rub my eye i go forward to a common car and be reward by two hour conversation with the strand break down husband abandon actress of a fourth rate strand break down manager bereft company. she be muzzy with beer reduce to her last dollar fearful that there would be no one to meet her at omaha and weep at interval because she have give the conductor a five dollar bill to change and he hadn t come back. he be an irishman so i know he couldn t steal and i address myself to the task of consolation. i be reward after a decent interval by the history of a life so wild so mix so desperately improbable and yet so simply probable and above all so quick not fast in it kaleidoscopic change that the pioneer would reject any summary of it. and so you will never know how she the beery woman with the tangle blond hair be once a girl on a farm in far off new jersey. how he a travel actor have woo and win her but paw he be always set against alf and how he and she embark all their little capital on the word of a faithless manager who disband his company a hundred mile from nowhere and how she and alf and a third person who have not yet make any noise in the world have to walk the railway track and beg from the farm house. how that third person arrive and go away again with a wail and how alf take to the whisky and other thing still more calculate to make a wife unhappy. and how after barn storm insult shoot scrape and pitiful collapse of poor company she have once win an encore. it be not a cheerful tale to listen to. there be a real actress in the pullman such an one a travel sumptuously with a maid and dress case and my draggle tail think of appeal to her for help but break down after several attempt to walk into the car jauntily a befit a sister in the profession. then the conductor reappear the five dollar bill honestly change and she weep by reason of beer and gratitude together and then fell asleep waveringly alone in the car and become almost beautiful and quite kissable. while the man with the sorrow stand at the door between actress and actress and preach grim sermon on the certain end of each if they do not mend their way and find regeneration through the miracle of the baptist creed. yes we be a queer company go up to the rockies together. i be the lucky because when a breakdown occur and we be delay for twelve hour i eat all the baptist s sample biscuit. they be various in composition but nourish. always travel with a drummer. 
no. xxxiv. 
across the great divide. and how the man gring show me the garment of the ellewomen. 
after much dally and more climb we come to a pas like all the bolan pass in the world and the black ca√±on of the gunnison call they it. we have be climb for very many hour and attain a modest elevation of some seven or eight thousand foot above the sea when we enter a gorge remote from the sun where the rock be two thousand foot sheer and where a rock splinter river roar and howl ten foot below a track which seem to have be build on the simple principle of drop miscellaneous dirt into the river and pin a few rail a top. there be a glory and a wonder and a mystery about that mad ride which i felt keenly. you will find it properly dress up in the guide book. until i have to offer prayer for the safety of the train. there be no hope of see the track two hundred yard ahead. we seem to be run into the bowel of the earth at the invitation of an irresponsible stream. then the solid rock would open and disclose a curve of awful twistfulness. then the driver put on all steam and we would go round that curve on one wheel chiefly the gunnison river gnash it teeth below. the car overhang the edge of the water and if a single one of the rail have choose to spread nothing in the wide world could have save u from drown. i know we should damage something in the end the sombre horror of the gorge the rush of the jade green water below and the cheerful tale tell by the conductor make me certain of the catastrophe. 
we have just clear the black ca√±on and another gorge and be sail out into open country nine thousand foot above the level of the sea when we come most suddenly round a corner upon a causeway across a waste water half dam and half quarry pool. the locomotive give one wild hoo. hoo. hoo. but it be too late. he be a beautiful bull and goodness only know why he have choose the track for a constitutional with his wife. she be fling to the leave but the cow catcher catch him_ and turn him round heave him shoulder deep into the pool. the expression of blank blind bewilderment on his bovine jovine face be wonderful to behold. he be not angry. i don t think he be even scar though he must have fly ten yard through the air. all he want to know be. will somebody have the goodness to tell a respectable old gentleman what in the world or out of it ha occur. and five minute late the stream that have be snap at our heel in the gorge split itself into a dozen silver thread on a breezy upland and become an innocent trout beck and we halt at a half dead city the name of which doe not remain with me. it have originally be build on the crest of a wave of prosperity. once ten thousand people have walk it street. but the boom have collapse. the great brick house and the factory be empty. the population live in little timber shanty on the fringe of the desert town. there be some railway workshop and thing and the hotel. whose pavement form the platform of the railway. contain one hundred and more room empty. the place in it half inhabitedness be more desolate than amber or chitor. but a man say. trout six pound two mile away and the sorrowful man and myself go in search of em. the town be ring by a circle of hill all alive with little thunder storm that break across the soft green of the plain in wisp and wash of smoke and amber. 
to our tiny party associate himself a lawyer from chicago. we foregather on the question of fly but i didn t expect to meet elijah pogram in the flesh. he deliver oration on the future of england and america and of the great federation that the year will bring forth when america and england will belt the globe with their link hand. accord to the notion of the british he make an as of himself but for all his high falutin he talk sense. i might knock through england on a four month tour and not find a man capable of put into word the passionate patriotism that possess the little chicago lawyer. and he be a man with point for he offer me three day shoot in illinois if i would step out of my path a little. i might travel for ten year up and down england ere i find a man who would give a complete strange so much a a sandwich and for twenty ere i squeeze a much enthusiasm out of a britisher. he and i talk politics and trout fly all one sultry day a we wander up and down the shallow of the stream aforesaid. little fish be sweet. i spend two hour whip a ripple for a fish that i know be there and in the pasture scent dusk catch a three pounder on a rag old brown hackle and land him after ten minute excite argument. he be a beauty. if ever any man work the western trout stream he would do well to bring out with him the dingy fly he posse. the native laugh at the tiny english hook but they hold and dun and drab and sober grey seem to tickle the √¶sthetic taste of the trout. for salmon. but don t say that i tell you. use the spoon gold on one side silver on the other. it be a kill a be a similar article with fish of another calibre. the native seem to use much too coarse tackle. 
it be a search for a small boy who should know the river that reveal to me a new phase of life slack slovenly and shiftless but very interest. there be a family in a pack case hut on the outskirt of the town. they have see the city when it be on the boom and make pretence of be the metropolis of the rockies. and when the boom be over they do not go. she be affable but deeply coat with dirt. he be grim and grimy and the little child be simply cake with filth of various description. but they live in a certain sort of squalid luxury six or eight of them in two room. and they enjoy the local society. it be their eight year old son whom i try to take out with me but he have be catch trout all his life and guess he didn t feel like come though i proffer him six shilling for what ought to have be a day s pleasuring. i ll stay with maw he say and from that attitude i could not move him. maw didn t attempt to argue with him. if he say he win t come he win t she say a though he be one of the elemental force of nature instead of a spankable brat. and paw lounge by the store refuse to interfere. maw tell me that she have be a school teacher in her not so distant youth but do not tell me what i be die to know how she arrive at this mucky tenement at the back of beyond and why. though preserve the prettiness of her new england speech she have come to regard wash a a luxury. paw chew tobacco and spat from time to time. yet when he open his mouth for other purpose he speak like a well educate man. there be a story there but i couldn t get at it. 
next day the man with the sorrow and myself and a few others begin the real ascent of the rockies. up to that time our climb didn t count. the train run violently up a steep place and be take to piece. five car be hitch on to two locomotive and two car to one locomotive. this seem to be a kind and thoughtful act but i be idiot enough to go forward and watch the couple on of the two rear car in which c√¶sar and his fortune be to travel. some one have lose or eat the regularly ordain couple and a man pick up from the tailboard of the engine a single iron link about a thick a a fetter link watch chain and guess it would do. get haul up a simla cliff by the hook of a lady s parasol if you wish to appreciate my sentiment when the car move uphill and the link draw tight. mile away and two thousand foot above our head rise the shoulder of a hill epauletted with the long line of a snow tunnel. the first section of the car crawl a quarter of a mile ahead of u the track snake and loop behind and there be a black drop to the leave. so we go up and up and up till the thin air grow thin and the chunk chunk chunk_ of the labour locomotive be answer by the oppress beat of the exhaust heart. through the cheque light and shade of the snow tunnel. horrible cavern of rude timbering. we grind our way halt now and again to allow a down train to pas. one monster of forty mineral car slide past scarce hold by four locomotive their brake scream and chortle in chorus. and in the end after a glimpse at half america spread mapwise league below u we halt at the head of the long snow tunnel of all on the crest of the divide between ten and eleven thousand foot above the level of the sea. the locomotive wish to draw breath and the passenger to gather the flower that nod impertinently through the chink of the board. a lady passenger s nose begin to bleed and other lady throw themselves down on the seat and gasp with the gasp train while a wind a keen a a knife edge riot down the grimy tunnel. 
then despatch a pilot engine to clear the way we begin the downward portion of the journey with every available brake on and frequent shriek till after some hour we reach the level plain and late the city of denver where the man with the sorrow go his way and leave me to journey on to omaha alone after one hasty glance at denver. the pulse of that town be too like the rush mighty wind in the rocky mountain tunnel. it make me tire because complete stranger desire me to do something to mine which be in mountain and to purchase build block upon inaccessible cliff. and once a woman urge that i should supply her with strong drink. i have almost forget that such attack be possible in any land for the outward and visible sign of public morality in american town be generally safe guard. for that i respect this people. omaha nebraska be but a halt place on the road to chicago but it reveal to me horror that i would not willingly have miss. the city to casual investigation seem to be populate entirely by german pole slav hungarian croat magyar and all the scum of the eastern european state but it must have be lay out by american. no other people would cut the traffic of a main street with two stream of railway line each some eight or nine track wide and cheerfully drive tram car across the metal. every now and again they have horrible railway cross accident at omaha but nobody seem to think of build an overhead bridge. that would interfere with the vest interest of the undertaker. 
be bless to hear some detail of one of that class. 
there be a shop the like of which i have never see before. it window be fill with dress coat for men and dress for woman. but the stud of the shirt be make of stamp cloth upon the shirt front and there be no trouser to those coat nothing but a sweep of cheap black cloth fall like an abb√© s frock. in the doorway sit a young man read pollock s course of time_ and by that i know that he be an undertaker. his name be gring which be a beautiful name and i talk to him on the mystery of his craft. he be an enthusiast and an artist. i tell him how corps be burn in india. say he. we re vastly superior. we hold that be to say embalm our dead. so. whereupon he produce the horrible weapon of his trade and most practically show me how you hold a man back from that corruption which be his birthright. and i wish i could live a few generation just to see how my people keep. but i m sure it s all right. nothing can touch em after i_ ve embalm em. then he display one of those ghastly dress suit and when i lay a shudder hand upon it behold it crumple to nothing for the white linen be sew on to the black cloth and there be no back to it. that be the horror. the garment be a shell. we dress a man in that say gring lay it out tastily on the counter. a you see here our casket have a plate glass window in front. oh me but that window in the coffin be fit with plush like a brougham window. and you don t see anything below the level of the man s waistcoat. consequently. he unroll the terrible cheap black cloth that fall down over the stark foot and i jump back. of course a man can be dress in his own clothe if he like but these be the regular thing. and for woman look at this. he take up the body of a high neck dinner dress in subdue lilac slash and puff and bedevil with black but like the dress suit backless and below the waist turn to shroud. that s for an old maid. but for young girl we give white with imitation pearl round the neck. that look very pretty through the window of the casket you see there s a cushion for the head with flower bank all round. can you imagine anything more awful than to take your last rest a much of a dead fraud a ever you be a live lie to go into the darkness one half of you shave trim and dress for an even party while the other half the half that your friend cannot see be enwrap in a flap black sheet. 
i know a little about burial custom in various place in the world and i try hard to make mr. gring comprehend dimly the awful heathendom that he be responsible for the grotesquerie the giggle horror of it all. but he couldn t see it. even when he show me a little boy s last suit he couldn t see it. he say it be quite right to embalm and trick out and hypocritically bedizen the poor innocent dead in their superior cushion and pillow casket with the window in front. 
bury me case in canvas like a fish rod in the deep sea. burn me on a back water of the hughli with damp wood and no oil. pin me under a pullman car and let the light stave do it bad. sizzle me with a fall electric wire or whelm me in the sludge of a break river dam. but may i never go down to the pit grin out of a plate glass window in a backless dress coat and the front half of a black stuff dress gown. not though i be hold against the ravage of the grave for ever and ever. amen. 
no. xxxv. 
how i strike chicago and how chicago strike me. of religion politics and pig stick and the incarnation of the city among shamble. 
i know thy cunning and thy greed thy hard high lust and wilful deed and all thy glory love to tell of specious gift material. 
i have strike a city a real city and they call it chicago. the other place do not count. san francisco be a pleasure resort a well a a city and salt lake be a phenomenon. this place be the first american city i have encounter. it hold rather more than a million people with body and stand on the same sort of soil a calcutta. have see it i urgently desire never to see it again. it be inhabit by savage. it water be the water of the hugli and it air be dirt. also it say that it be the bos town of america. 
i do not believe that it ha anything to do with this country. they tell me to go to the palmer house which be a gild and mirror rabbit warren and there i find a huge hall of tessellate marble cram with people talk about money and spit about everywhere. other barbarian charge in and out of this inferno with letter and telegram in their hand and yet others shout at each other. a man who have drink quite a much a be good for him tell me that this be the fine hotel in the fine city on god almighty s earth. by the way when an american wish to indicate the next county or state he say god a mighty s earth. this prevent discussion and flatter his vanity. 
then i go out into the street which be long and flat and without end. and verily it be not a good thing to live in the east for any length of time. your idea grow to clash with those hold by every right think white man. i look down interminable vista flank with nine ten and fifteen storied house and crowd with men and woman and the show impress me with a great horror. except in london and i have forget what london be like i have never see so many white people together and never such a collection of miserables. there be no colour in the street and no beauty only a maze of wire rope overhead and dirty stone flag underfoot. a cab driver volunteer to show me the glory of the town for so much an hour and with him i wander far. he conceive that all this turmoil and squash be a thing to be reverently admire. that it be good to huddle men together in fifteen layer one atop of the other and to dig hole in the grind for office. he say that chicago be a live town and that all the creature hurry by me be engage in business. that be to say they be try to make some money that they might not die through lack of food to put into their belly. he take me to canal black a ink and fill with untold abomination and bid me watch the stream of traffic across the bridge. he then take me into a saloon and while i drink make me note that the floor be cover with coin sink into cement. a hottentot would not have be guilty of this sort of barbarism. the coin make an effect pretty enough but the man who put them there have no think to beauty and therefore he be a savage. then my cab driver show me business block gay with sign and stud with fantastic and absurd advertisement of good and look down the long street so adorn it be a though each vender stand at his door howl. for the sake of money employ or buy of me and me only. have you ever see a crowd at our famine relief distribution. you know then how men leap into the air stretch out their arm above the crowd in the hope of be see. while the woman dolorously slap the stomach of their child and whimper. i have sooner watch famine relief than the white man engage in what he call legitimate competition. the one i understand. the other make me ill. and the cabman say that these thing be the proof of progress. and by that i know he have be read his newspaper a every intelligent american should. the paper tell their reader in language fit to their comprehension that the snarl together of telegraph wire the heave up of house and the make of money be progress. 
i spend ten hour in that huge wilderness wander through score of mile of these terrible street and jostle some few hundred thousand of these terrible people who talk money through their nose. the cabman leave me. but after a while i pick up another man who be full of figure and into my ear he pour them a occasion require or the big blank factory suggest. here they turn out so many hundred thousand dollar worth of such and such an article. there so many million other thing. this house be worth so many million dollar. that one so many million more or le. it be like listen to a child babble of it hoard of shell. it be like watch a fool play with button. but i be expect to do more than listen or watch. he demand that i should admire. and the utmost that i could say be. be these thing so. then i be very sorry for you. that make him angry and he say that insular envy make me unresponsive. so you see i could not make him understand. 
about four and a half hour after adam be turn out of the garden of eden he felt hungry and so bid eve take care that her head be not break by the descend fruit shin up a cocoanut palm. that hurt his leg cut his breast and make him breathe heavily and eve be torment with fear l her lord should miss his foot and so bring the tragedy of this world to an end ere the curtain have fairly rise. have i meet adam then i should have be sorry for him. to day i find eleven hundred thousand of his son just a far advance a their father in the art of get food and immeasurably inferior to him in that they think that their palm tree lead straight to the sky. consequently i be sorry in rather more than a million different way. in our east bread come naturally even to the poor by a little scratch or the gift of a friend not quite so poor. in le favour country one be apt to forget. then i go to bed. and that be on a saturday night. 
sunday bring me the queer experience of all a revelation of barbarism complete. i find a place that be officially describe a a church. it be a circus really but that the worshipper do not know. there be flower all about the build which be fit up with plush and stain oak and much luxury include twist brass candlestick of severe gothic design. to these thing and a congregation of savage enter suddenly a wonderful man completely in the confidence of their god whom he treat colloquially and exploit very much a a newspaper reporter would exploit a foreign potentate. but unlike the newspaper reporter he never allow his listener to forget that he and not he be the centre of attraction. with a voice of silver and with imagery borrow from the auction room he build up for his hearer a heaven on the line of the palmer house. but with all the gild real gold and all the plate glass diamond. and set in the centre of it a loud voice argumentative and very shrewd creation that he call god. one sentence at this point catch my delight ear. it be apropos of some question of the judgment day and run. no. i tell you god doesn t do business that way. he be give them a deity whom they could comprehend in a gold and jewel heaven in which they could take a natural interest. he interlard his performance with the slang of the street the counter and the exchange and he say that religion ought to enter into daily life. consequently i presume he introduce it a daily life his own and the life of his friend. 
then i escape before the bless desire no benediction at such hand. but the person who listen seem to enjoy themselves and i understand that i have meet with a popular preacher. late on when i have peruse the sermon of a gentleman call talmage and some others i perceive that i have be listen to a very mild specimen. yet that man with his brutal gold and silver idol his hand in pocket cigar in mouth and hat on the back of the head style of deal with the sacred vessel would count himself spiritually quite competent to send a mission to convert the indian. all that sunday i listen to people who say that the mere fact of spike down strip of iron to wood and get a steam and iron thing to run along them be progress. that the telephone be progress and the network of wire overhead be progress. they repeat their statement again and again. one of them take me to their city hall and board of trade work and point it out with pride. it be very ugly but very big and the street in front of it be narrow and unclean. when i saw the face of the men who do business in that build i felt that there have be a mistake in their billet. 
by the way ti a consolation to feel that i be not write to an english audience. then should i have to fall into feign ecstasy over the marvellous progress of chicago since the day of the great fire to allude casually to the raise of the entire city so many foot above the level of the lake which it face and generally to grovel before the golden calf. but you who be desperately poor and therefore by these standard of no account know thing and will understand when i write that they have manage to get a million of men together on flat land and that the bulk of these men appear to be low than mahajans and not so companionable a a punjabi jat after harvest. but i don t think it be the blind hurry of the people their argot and their grand ignorance of thing beyond their immediate interest that displease me so much a a study of the daily paper of chicago. imprimis there be some sort of dispute between new york and chicago a to which town should give an exhibition of product to be hereafter holden and through the medium of their more dignify journal the two city be ya hooing and hi yi ing at each other like opposition newsboy. they call it humour but it sound like something quite different. that be only the first trouble. the second lay in the tone of the production. lead article which include gem such a. back of such and such a place or we notice tuesday such an event or don t for doe not be thing to be accept with thankfulness. all that make me want to cry be that in these paper be faithfully reproduce all the war cry and back talk of the palmer house bar the slang of the barber shop the mental elevation and integrity of the pullman car porter the dignity of the dime museum and the accuracy of the excite fishwife. i be sternly forbid to believe that the paper educate the public. then i be compel to believe that the public educate the paper. 
just when the sense of unreality and oppression be strong upon me and when i most want help a man sit at my side and begin to talk what he call politics. i have chance to pay about six shilling for a travel cap worth eighteen penny and he make of the fact a text for a sermon. he say that this be a rich country and that the people like to pay two hundred per cent on the value of a thing. they could afford it. he say that the government impose a protective duty of from ten to seventy per cent on foreign make article and that the american manufacturer consequently could sell his good for a healthy sum. thus an import hat would with duty cost two guinea. the american manufacturer would make a hat for seventeen shilling and sell it for one pound fifteen. in these thing he say lay the greatness of america and the effeteness of england. competition between factory and factory keep the price down to decent limit but i be never to forget that this people be a rich people not like the pauper continentals and that they enjoy pay duty. to my weak intellect this seem rather like juggle with counter. everything that i have yet purchase cost about twice a much a it would in england and when native make be of inferior quality. moreover since these line be first think of i have visit a gentleman who own a factory which use to produce thing. he own the factory still. not a man be in it but he be draw a handsome income from a syndicate of firm for keep it close in order that it might not produce thing. this man say that if protection be abandon a tide of pauper labour would flood the country and a i look at his factory i think how entirely good it be to have no labour of any kind whatever rather than face so horrible a future. meantime do you remember that this peculiar country enjoy pay money for value not receive. i be an alien and for the life of me cannot see why six shilling should be pay for eighteen penny cap or eight shilling for half crown cigar case. when the country fill up to a decently populate level a few million people who be not alien will be smite with the same sort of blindness. 
but my friend s assertion somehow thoroughly suit the grotesque ferocity of chicago. see now and judge. in the village of isser jang on the road to montgomery there be four changar woman who winnow corn some seventy bushel a year. beyond their hut life puran das the money lender who on good security lend a much a five thousand rupee in a year. jowala singh the lohar_ mend the village plough some thirty break at the share in three hundred and sixty five day. and hukm chund who be letter writer and head of the little club under the traveller tree generally keep the village post in such gossip a the barber and the midwife have not yet make public property. chicago husk and winnow her wheat by the million bushel a hundred bank lend hundred of million of dollar in the year and score of factory turn out plough gear and machinery by steam. score of daily paper do work which hukm chund and the barber and the midwife perform with due regard for public opinion in the village of isser jang. so far a manufacture go the difference between chicago on the lake and isser jang on the montgomery road be one of degree only and not of kind. a far a the understand of the us of life go isser jang for all it seasonal cholera ha the advantage over chicago. jowala singh know and take care to avoid the three or four ghoul haunt field on the outskirt of the village. but he be not urge by million of devil to run about all day in the sun and swear that his ploughshare be the best in the punjab. nor doe puran das fly forth in a cart more than once or twice a year and he know on a pinch how to use the railway and the telegraph a well a any son of israel in chicago. but this be absurd. the east be not the west and these men must continue to deal with the machinery of life and to call it progress. their very preacher dare not rebuke them. they gloss over the hunt for money and the twice sharpen bitterness of adam s curse by say that such thing dower a man with a large range of thought and high aspiration. they do not say. free yourself from your own slavery but rather if you can possibly manage it do not set quite so much store on the thing of this world. and they do not know what the thing of this world be. 
i go off to see cattle kill by way of clear my head which a you will perceive be get muddle. they say every englishman go to the chicago stockyard. you shall find them about six mile from the city. and once have see them will never forget the sight. a far a the eye can reach stretch a township of cattle pen cunningly divide into block so that the animal of any pen can be speedily drive out close to an incline timber path which lead to an elevate cover way straddle high above the pen. these viaduct be two storied. on the upper storey tramp the doom cattle stolidly for the most part. on the low with a scuffle of sharp hoof and multitudinous yell run the pig. the same end be appoint for each. thus you will see the gang of cattle wait their turn a they wait sometimes for day. and they need not be distress by the sight of their fellow run about in the fear of death. all they know be that a man on horseback cause their next door neighbour to move by mean of a whip. certain bar and fence be unshipped and behold that crowd have go up the mouth of a slop tunnel and return no more. it be different with the pig. they shriek back the news of the exodus to their friend and a hundred pen skirl responsive. it be to the pig i first address myself. select a viaduct which be full of them a i could hear though i could not see i mark a sombre build whereto it run and go there not unalarmed by stray cattle who have manage to escape from their proper quarter. a pleasant smell of brine warn me of what be come. i enter the factory and find it full of pork in barrel and on another storey more pork unbarrelled and in a huge room the half of swine for whose use great lump of ice be be pitch in at the window. that room be the mortuary chamber where the pig lie for a little while in state ere they begin their progress through such passage a king may sometimes travel. turn a corner and not note an overhead arrangement of grease rail wheel and pulley i run into the arm of four eviscerate carcass all pure white and of a human aspect be push by a man clothe in vehement red. when i leap aside the floor be slippery under me. there be a flavour of farmyard in my nostril and the shout of a multitude in my ear. but there be no joy in that shout. twelve men stand in two line six a side. between them and overhead run the railway of death that have nearly shunt me through the window. each man carry a knife the sleeve of his shirt be cut off at the elbow and from bosom to heel he be blood red. the atmosphere be stifle a a night in the rain by reason of the steam and the crowd. i climb to the begin of thing and perch upon a narrow beam overlook very nearly all the pig ever breed in wisconsin. they have just be shoot out of the mouth of the viaduct and huddle together in a large pen. thence they be flick persuasively a few at a time into a small chamber and there a man fix tackle on their hind leg so that they rise in the air suspend from the railway of death. oh. it be then they shriek and call on their mother and make promise of amendment till the tackle man punt them in their back and they slide head down into a brick floor passage very like a big kitchen sink that be blood red. there await them a red man with a knife which he pass jauntily through their throat and the full voice shriek become a sputter and then a fall a of heavy tropical rain. the red man who be back against the passage wall stand clear of the wildly kick hoof and pass his hand over his eye not from any feel of compassion but because the spurt blood be in his eye and he have barely time to stick the next arrival. then that first stick swine drop still kick into a great vat of boil water and speak no more word but wallow in obedience to some unseen machinery and presently come forth at the low end of the vat and be heave on the blade of a blunt paddle wheel thing which say hough. hough. hough. and skelped all the hair off him except what little a couple of men with knife could remove. then he be again hitch by the heel to that say railway and pass down the line of the twelve men each man with a knife leave with each man a certain amount of his individuality which be take away in a wheel barrow and when he reach the last man he be very beautiful to behold but immensely unstuff and limp. preponderance of individuality be ever a bar to foreign travel. that pig could have be in no case to visit you in india have he not part with some of his most cherish notion. 
the dissect part impress me not so much a the slay. they be so excessively alive these pig. and then they be so excessively dead and the man in the drip clammy hot passage do not seem to care and ere the blood of such an one have cease to foam on the floor such another and four friend with him have shriek and die. but a pig be only the unclean animal forbid by the prophet. 
i be destine to make rather a queer discovery when i go over to the cattle slaughter. all the building here be on a much large scale and there be no sound of trouble but i could smell the salt reek of blood before i set foot in the place. the cattle do not come directly through the viaduct a the pig have do. they debouch into a yard by the hundred and they be big red brute carry much flesh. in the centre of that yard stand a red texan steer with a headstall on his wicked head. no man control him. he be so to speak pick his teeth and whistle in an open byre of his own when the cattle arrive. a soon a the first one have fearfully quit the viaduct this red devil put his hand in his pocket and slouch across the yard no man guide him. then he low something to the effect that he be the regularly appoint guide of the establishment and would show them round. they be country folk but they know how to behave. and so follow juda some hundred strong patiently and with a look of bland wonder in their face. i saw his broad back jog in advance of them up a lime wash incline where i be forbid to follow. then a door shut and in a minute back come juda with the air of a virtuous plough bullock and take up his place in his byre. somebody laugh across the yard but i hear no sound of cattle from the big brick build into which the mob have disappear. only juda chew the cud with a malignant satisfaction and so i know there be trouble and run round to the front of the factory and so enter and stand aghast. 
who take count of the prejudice which we absorb through the skin by way of our surround. it be not the spectacle that impress me. the first think that almost speak itself aloud be. they be kill kine. and it be a shock. the pig be nobody s concern but cattle the brother of the cow the sacred cow be quite otherwise. the next time an m. p. tell me that india either sultanises or brahminises a man i shall believe about half what he say. it be unpleasant to watch the slaughter of cattle when one ha laugh at the notion for a few year. i could not see actually what be do in the first instance because the row of stall in which they lay be separate from me by fifty impassable foot of butcher and sling carcass. all i know be that men swing open the door of a stall a occasion require and there lay two steer already stun and breathe heavily. these two they pole ax and half raise them by tackle they cut their throat. two men skin each carcase somebody cut off the head and in half a minute more the overhead rail carry two side of beef to their appoint place. there be clamour enough in the operate room but from the wait cattle invisible on the other side of the line of pen never a sound. they go to their death trust juda without a word. they be slay at the rate of five a minute and if the pig men be spatter with blood the cow butcher be bath in it. the blood run in mutter gutter. there be no place for hand or foot that be not coat with thickness of dry blood and the stench of it in the nostril breed fear. 
and then the same merciful providence that ha shower good thing on my path throughout send me an embodiment of the city of chicago so that i might remember it forever. woman come sometimes to see the slaughter a they would come to see the slaughter of men. and there enter that vermilion hall a young woman of large mould with brilliantly scarlet lip and heavy eyebrow and dark hair that come in a widow s peak on the forehead. she be well and healthy and alive and she be dress in flame red and black and her foot. know you that the foot of american woman be like unto the foot of fairy. her foot i say be case in red leather shoe. she stand in a patch of sunlight the red blood under her shoe the vivid carcass pack round her a bullock bleed it life away not six foot away from her and the death factory roar all round her. she look curiously with hard bold eye and be not ashamed. 
then say i. this be a special send. i have see the city of chicago. and i go away to get peace and rest.

how i find peace at musquash on the monongahela. 
prince blow by many a western breeze our vessel greet you treasure lade. we send them all but best of these a free and frank young yankee maiden. 
it be a mean thing and an unhandsome to do a continent in five hundred mile jump. but after those swine and bullock at chicago i felt that complete change of air would be good. the unite state at present hinge in or about chicago a a double leave screen hinge. to be sure the tiny new england state call a trip to pennsylvania go west but the large mind citizen seem to reckon his longitude from chicago. twenty year hence the centre of population that shade square on the census map will have shift men say far west of chicago. twenty year late it will be on the pacific slope. twenty year after that america will begin to crowd up and there will be some trouble. people will demand manufacture good for their reduce establishment household at the cheap possible rate and the cry that the land be rich enough to afford protection will cease with a great abruptness. at present it be the farmer who pay most dearly for the luxury of high price. in the old day when the land be fresh and there be plenty of it and it crop like the garden of eden he do not mind pay. now there be not so much free land and the old acre be need stimulant which cost money and the farmer who pay for everything be begin to ask question. also the great american nation which individually never shut a door behind it noble self very seldom attempt to put back anything that it ha take from nature s shelf. it grab all it can and move on. but the move on be nearly finish and the grab must stop and then the federal government will have to establish a wood and forest department the like of which be never see in the world before. and all the people who have be accustom to hack mangle and burn timber a they please will object with shot and protestation to this infringement of their right. the nigger will breed bounteously and he will have to be reckon with. and the manufacturer will have to be content with small profit and he will have to be reckon with. and the railway will no long rule the country through which they run and they will have to be reckon with. and nobody will approve of it in the least. 
yes. it will be a spectacle for all the world to watch this big slash colt of a nation that ha get off with a fly start on a freshly litter course be pull back to the ruck by that very mutton fisted jockey necessity. there will be excitement in america when a few score million of sovereign discover that what they consider the outcome of their own government be but the rapidly diminish bounty of nature. and that if they want to get on comfortably they must tackle every single problem from labour to finance humbly without gasconade and afresh. but at present they look that all the to morrow shall be a to day and if you argue with them they say that the democratic idea will keep thing go. they believe in that idea and the le well inform fortify themselves in their belief by curious assertion a to the despotism that exist in england. this be pure provincialism of course. but it be very funny to listen to especially when you compare the theory with the practice. pistol chiefly. a prove in the newspaper. i have strive to find out where the central authority of the land lie. it isn t at washington because the federal government can t do anything to the state save run the mail and collect a federal tax or two. it isn t in the state because the township can do a they like. and it isn t in the township because these be boss by alien voter or ring of patriotic homebred citizen. and it certainly be not in the citizen because they be govern and coerce by despotic power of public opinion a represent by their paper preacher or local society. i find one man who tell me that if anything go wrong in this huge congress of king if there be a split or an upheaval or a smash the people in detail would be subject to the idea of the sovereign people in mass. this be a survival from the civil war when you remember the people in a majority do with gun and sword slay and wind the people in detail. all the same the notion seem very much like the worship by the savage of the unload rifle a it lean against the wall. 
but the men and woman set u an example in patriotism. they believe in their land and it future and it honour and it glory and they be not ashamed to say so. from the large to the least run this same proud passionate conviction to which i take off my hat and for which i love them. an average english householder seem to regard his country a an abstraction to supply him with policeman and fire brigade. the cockney cad cannot understand what the word mean. the bloomin toff he know and the law and the soldier that supply him with a spectacle in the park. but he would laugh in your face at the notion of any duty be owe by himself to his land. pick an american of the second generation anywhere you please from the cab rank the porter s room or the plough tail specially the plough tail and that man will make you understand in five minute that he understand what manner of thing his republic be. he might laugh at a law that didn t suit his convenience draw your eye teeth in a bargain and applaud cuteness on the out verge of swindle. but you should hear him stand up and sing. 
my country ti of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i sing. 
i have hear a few thousand of them engage in that employment. i respect him. there be too much romeo and too little balcony about our national anthem. with the american article it be all balcony. there must be bear a poet who shall give the english the song of their own own country which be to say of about half the world. remain then only to compose the great song of all the saga of the anglo saxon all round the earth a p√¶an that shall combine the terrible slow swing of the battle hymn of the republic. which if you know not get chant to you. with britannia need no bulwarks_ the skirl of the british grenadier with that perfect quickstep march through georgia_ and at the end the wail of the dead march. for we even we who share the earth between u a no god have ever share it we also be mortal in the matter of our single self. will any one take the contract. 
it be with these ramble notion that i arrive at the infinite peace of the tiny township of musquash on the monongahela river. the clang and tumult of chicago belong to another world. imagine a roll wooded english landscape under soft of blue sky dot at three mile interval with fat little quiet little village or aggressive little manufacture town that the tree and the fold of the hill mercifully prevent from betray their presence. the golden rod blaze in the pasture against the green of the mullein and the cow pick their way home through the twist path between the blackberry bush. all summer be on the orchard and the apple such apple a we dream of when we eat the woolly imitation of kashmir be ripe and toothsome. it be good to lie in a hammock with half shut eye and in the utter stillness to hear the apple drop from the tree and the tinkle of the cowbell a the cow walk statelily down the main road of the village. everybody in that restful place seem to have just a much a he want. a house with all comfortable appliance a big or little verandah wherein to spend the day a neatly shave garden with a wild wealth of flower some cow and an orchard. everybody know everybody else intimately and what they do not know the local daily paper a daily for a village of twelve hundred people. supply. there be a court house where justice be do and a jail where some most enviable prisoner live and there be four or five church of four or five denomination. also it be impossible to buy openly any liquor in that little paradise. but and this be a very serious but you could by procure a medical certificate get strong drink from the chemist. that be the drawback of prohibition. it make a man who want a drink a shirker and a contriver which thing be not good for the soul of a man and presently specially if he be young cause him to believe that he may just a well be hang for a sheep a for a lamb. and the end of that young man be not pretty. nothing except a rattle fall will persuade an average colt that a fence be not mean to be jump over. whereas if he be turn out into the open he learn to carry himself with discretion. one hear a good deal of this same dread of drink in musquash and even the maiden seem to know too much about it effect upon certain unregenerate youth who if they have be once make thoroughly effectually and persistently drink with a tepid brandy and soda thrust before their goose flesh nose on the terrible next morning would perhaps have see the futility of their way. it be a sin by village canon to imbibe lager though experto crede you can get dropsy on that stuff long before you can get drink. but what man know his mind. besides it be all their own affair. 
the little community seem to be a self contain a an indian village. have the rest of the land sink under the sea musquash would have go on send it son to school in order to make them good citizen which be the constant prayer of the true american father settle it own road make local ce town lot arbitration and internal government by ballot and vote and due respect to the voice of the headman. which be the salvation of the ballot. until such time a all should take their place in the cemetery appoint for their faith. here be american and no alien men rule themselves by themselves and for themselves and their wife and their child in peace order and decency. 
but what go straight to this heart though they do not know it be that they be methody folk for the most part ay methody a ever tread a yorkshire moor or drive on a sunday to some chapel of the faith in the dale. the old methody talk be there with the discipline whereby the soul of the just be sometimes to their intense vexation make perfect on this earth in order that they may take out their letter and live and die in good stand. if you don t know the talk you win t know what that mean. the discipline or dis_cip_line be no thing to be trifle with and it work among a congregation depend entirely upon the tact humanity and sympathy of the leader who work it. he know what youth s desire be can turn the soul in the direction of good gently instead of wrench it savagely towards the right path only to see it break away quiver and scar. the arm of the dis_cip_line be long. a maiden tell me a a new and strange fact and one that would interest a foreigner of a friend of hers who have once be admonish by some elder somewhere not in musquash for the heinous crime of dance. she the friend do not in the least like it. she would not. can t you imagine the delightful result of a formal wigging administer by a youngish and austere elder who be not accustom to make allowance for the natural dance instinct of the young of the human animal. the hot iron that be hold forth to scare may also sear a those who have ever lie under an unfortunate exposition of the old faith can attest. 
but it be all immensely interest the absolutely fresh wholesome sweet life that pay due reverence to the thing of the next world but take good care to get enough tennis in the cool of the even. that concern itself a honestly and thoroughly with the daily round the trivial task. and that same task be anything but trivial when you be help by an american help. a with the salvation of the soul. i have the honour of meet in the flesh even a miss louisa alcott draw them meg and joe and beth and amy whom you ought to know. there be no affectation of concealment in their life who have nothing to conceal. there be many little woman in that place because even a be the case in england the boy have go out to seek their fortune. some be work in the thunder clang city others have remove to the infinite west and others have disappear in the languid lazy south. and the maiden wait their return which be the custom of maiden all over the world. then the boy would come back in the soft sunlight attire in careful raiment their tongue cleanse of evil word and discourtesy. they have just come to call bless their carefully groom head so they have and the maiden in white dress glimmer like ghost on the stoop and receive them accord to their merit. mamma have nothing to do with this nor papa either for he be down town try to drive reason into the head of a land surveyor. and all along the shade lazy intimate street you hear the garden gate click and clash a the mood of the man vary and burst of pleasant laughter where three or four be sure the white muslin be among them discuss a picnic past or a buggy drive to come. then the couple go their way and talk together till the young men have to go at last on account of the train and all troop joyously down to the station and think no harm of it. and indeed why should they. from her fifteenth year the american maiden move among the boy a a sister among brother. they be her servant to take her out rid which be drive to give her flower and candy. the last two item be expensive and this be good for the young man a teach him to value friendship that cost a little in cash and may necessitate economy on the cigar side. a to the maiden she be teach to respect herself that her fate be in her own hand and that she be the more stringently bind by the very measure of the liberty so freely accord to her. wherefore in her own language she ha a lovely time with about two or three hundred boy who have sister of their own and a very accurate perception that if they be unworthy of their trust a syndicate of other boy would probably pas them into a world where there be neither marry nor give in marriage. and so time go till the maiden know the other side of the house know that a man be not a demi god nor a mysteriously veil monster but an average egotistical vain gluttonous but on the whole companionable sort of person to be soothe feed and manage knowledge that doe not come to her sister in england till after a few year of matrimony. and then she make her choice. the golden light touch eye that be full of comprehension. but the light be golden none the le for she make just the same sweet irrational choice that an english girl doe. with this advantage. she know a little more ha experience in entertain insight into the business employ and hobby of men gather from countless talk with the boy and talk with the other girl who find time at those mysterious conclave to discus what tom ted stuke or jack have be do. thus it happen that she be a companion in the full sense of the word of the man she wed zealous for the interest of the firm to be consult in time of stress and to be call upon for help and sympathy in time of danger. pleasant it be that one heart should beat for you. but it be good when the head above that heart ha be think hard on your behalf and when the lip that be also very pleasant to kiss give wise counsel. 
when the american maiden i speak now for the rank and file of that noble army be once marry why it be finish. she ha have her lovely time. it may have be five seven or ten year accord to circumstance. she abdicate promptly with startle speed and her place know her no more except a with her husband. the queen be dead or look after the house. this same household work seem to be the thing that age the american woman. she be infamously help by the irish trollop and the negress alike. it be not fair upon her because she ha to do three part of the housework herself and in dry nerve strain air the chore be a burden. be thankful o my people for mauz baksh kadir baksh and the ayah while they be with you. they be twice a handy a the unkempt slattern of the furnish apartment to which you will return commissioner though you be. and five time a clever a the amelia araminta rebellia secessia jackson. colour. under whose ineptitude and insolence the young american housewife groan. but all this be far enough from peaceful placid musquash and it boundless cordiality it simple genuine hospitality and it what s the french word that just cover all. gra gracieuseness_ isn t it. oh be good to an american wherever you meet him. put him up for the club and he will hold you listen till three in the morning. give him the best tent and the gram feed mutton. i have incur a debt of salt that i can never repay but do you return it piecemeal to any of that nation and the account will be on my head till our path in the world cross again. he drink ice water just a we do. but he doesn t quite like our cigar. 
and how shall i finish the tale. would it interest you to learn of the picnic in the hot still wood that overhang the monongahela when those idiotic american buggy that can t turn round get stick among the bramble and all but capsize. of boat in the blaze sun on the river that but a little time before have cast at the foot of the horrify village the corps of the johnstown tragedy. i saw one only one remnant of that terrible wreck. he have be a minister. house church congregation wife and child have be sweep away from him in one night of terror. he have no employment. he could have employ himself at nothing. but god have be very good to him. he sit in the sun and smile a little weakly. it be in his poor blur mind that something have happen he be not sure what it be but undoubtedly something have occur. one could only pray that the light would never return. 
but there be many picture on my mind. of a huge manufacture city of three hundred thousand soul light and warm by natural gas so that the great valley full of flame furnace send up no smoke wreath to the clear sky. of musquash itself light by the same mysterious agency flare of gas eight foot long roar day and night at the corner of the grass grow street because it wasn t worth while to turn them out. of fleet of coal flat be haul down the river on an interminable journey to st. louis. of factory nestle in wood where all the axe handle and shovel in the world seem to be manufacture daily. and last of that quaint forget german community the brotherhood of perpetual separation who found themselves when the state be yet young and land cheap and be now die out because they will neither marry nor give in marriage and their recruit be very few. the advance in the value of land ha almost smother these poor old people in a golden affluence that they never desire. they live in a little village where the house be build old dutch fashion with their front door away from the road and cobble path all about. the cloister peace of musquash be a metropolitan riot beside the hush of that village. and there be too a love tale tuck away among the flower. it ha take seventy year in the tell for the brother and sister love each other well but they love their duty to the brotherhood more. so they have live and still do live see each other daily and separate for all time. any trouble that might have be be altogether wipe out of their face which be a calm a those of very little child. to the uninitiated those constant one resemble extremely old people in garment of absurd cut. but they love each other and that seem to bring one back quite naturally to the girl and the boy in musquash. the boy be nice boy graduate of yale of course. you mustn t mention harvard here but none the le skilled in business in stock and share the bore for oil and the sale of everything that can be sell by one sinner to another. skilled too in baseball big shoulder with straight eye and square chin but not above occasional diversion and mild orgy. they will make good citizen and posse the earth and eventually wed one of the nice white muslin dress. there be bad thing in this world than be one of the boy in musquash.

the idea of chase half a dozen relative in addition to mark twain up and down a city of thirty thousand inhabitant keep me awake. morning reveal elmira whose street be desolate by railway track and whose suburb be give up to the manufacture of door sash and window frame. it be surround by pleasant fat little hill rim with timber and top with cultivation. the chemung river flow generally up and down the town and have just finish flood a few of the main street. 
the hotel man and the telephone man assure me that the much desire brother in law be out of town and no one seem to know where the man clemens abide. late on i discover that he have not summer in that place for more than nineteen season and so be comparatively a new arrival. 
a friendly policeman volunteer the news that he have see twain or some one very like him drive a buggy the day before. this give me a delightful sense of nearness. fancy live in a town where you could see the author of tom sawyer_ or some one very like him jolt over the pavement in a buggy. 
he life out yonder at east hill say the policeman. three mile from here. 
then the chase begin in a hire hack up an awful hill where sunflower blossom by the roadside and crop wave and harper s magazine cow stand in eligible and command attitude knee deep in clover all ready to be transfer to photogravure. the great man must have be persecute by outsider aforetime and flee up the hill for refuge. 
presently the driver stop at a miserable little white wood shanty and demand mister clemens. 
i know he s a big bug and all that he explain but you can never tell what sort of notion those sort of men take into their head to live in anyways. 
there rise up a young lady who be sketch thistle top and goldenrod amid a plentiful supply of both and set the pilgrimage on the right path. 
it s a pretty gothic house on the leave hand side a little way farther on. 
gothic h say the driver. very few of the city hack take this drive specially if they know they be come out here and he glare at me savagely. 
it be a very pretty house anything but gothic clothe with ivy stand in a very big compound and front by a verandah full of chair and hammock. the roof of the verandah be a trellis work of creeper and the sun peep through move on the shin board below. 
decidedly this remote place be an ideal one for work if a man could work among these soft air and the murmur of the long eared crop. 
appear suddenly a lady use to deal with rampageous outsider. mr. clemens ha just walk down town. he be at his brother in law s house. 
then he be within shout distance after all and the chase have not be in vain. with speed i flee and the driver skid the wheel and swear audibly arrive at the bottom of that hill without accident. it be in the pause that follow between ring the brother in law s bell and get an answer that it occur to me for the first time mark twain might possibly have other engagement than the entertainment of escape lunatic from india be they never so full of admiration. and in another man s house anyhow what have i come to do or say. suppose the draw room should be full of people suppose a baby be sick how be i to explain that i only want to shake hand with him. 
then thing happen somewhat in this order. a big darken draw room. a huge chair. a man with eye a mane of grizzle hair a brown mustache cover a mouth a delicate a a woman s a strong square hand shake mine and the slow calm levellest voice in all the world say. 
well you think you owe me something and you ve come to tell me so. that s what i call square a debt handsomely. 
piff. from a cob pipe. i always say that a missouri meerschaum be the best smoke in the world. and behold. mark twain have curl himself up in the big armchair and i be smoke reverently a befit one in the presence of his superior. 
the thing that strike me first be that he be an elderly man. yet after a minute s think i perceive that it be otherwise and in five minute the eye look at me i saw that the grey hair be an accident of the most trivial. he be quite young. i be shake his hand. i be smoke his cigar and i be hear him talk this man i have learn to love and admire fourteen thousand mile away. 
read his book i have strive to get an idea of his personality and all my preconceive notion be wrong and beneath the reality. bless be the man who find no disillusion when he be bring face to face with a revere writer. that be a moment to be remember. the land of a twelve pound salmon be nothing to it. i have hook mark twain and he be treat me a though under certain circumstance i might be an equal. 
about this time i become aware that he be discuss the copyright question. here so far a i remember be what he say. attend to the word of the oracle through this unworthy medium transmit. you will never be able to imagine the long slow surge of the drawl and the deadly gravity of the countenance the quaint pucker of the body one foot throw over the arm of the chair the yellow pipe clinch in one corner of the mouth and the right hand casually caress the square chin. 
copyright. some men have moral and some men have other thing. i presume a publisher be a man. he be not bear. he be create by circumstance. some publisher have moral. mine have. they pay me for the english production of my book. when you hear men talk of bret harte s work and other work and my book be pirate ask them to be sure of their fact. i think they ll find the book be pay for. it be ever thus. 
i remember an unprincipled and formidable publisher. perhaps he s dead now. he use to take my short story i can t call it steal or pirate them. it be beyond these thing altogether. he take my story one at a time and make a book of it. if i write an essay on dentistry or theology or any little thing of that kind just an essay that long. he indicate half an inch on his finger. any sort of essay that publisher would amend and improve my essay. 
he would get another man to write some more to it or cut it about exactly a his need require. then he would publish a book call dentistry by mark twain_ that little essay and some other thing not mine add. theology would make another book and so on. i do not consider that fair. it s an insult. but he s dead now i think. i didn t kill him. 
there be a great deal of nonsense talk about international copyright. the proper way to treat a copyright be to make it exactly like real estate in every way. 
it will settle itself under these condition. if congress be to bring in a law that a man s life be not to extend over a hundred and sixty year somebody would laugh. that law wouldn t concern anybody. the man would be out of the jurisdiction of the court. a term of year in copyright come to exactly the same thing. no law can make a book live or cause it to die before the appoint time. 
tottletown cal. be a new town with a population of three thousand bank fire brigade brick building and all the modern improvement. it live it flourish and it disappear. to day no man can put his foot on any remnant of tottletown cal. it s dead. london continue to exist. bill smith author of a book read for the next year or so be real estate in tottletown. william shakespeare whose work be extensively read be real estate in london. let bill smith equally with mr. shakespeare now decease have a complete a control over his copyright a he would over his real estate. let him gamble it away drink it away or give it to the church. let his heir and assign treat it in the same manner. 
every now and again i go up to washington sit on a board to drive that sort of view into congress. congress take it argument against international copyright deliver ready make and congress isn t very strong. i put the real estate view of the case before one of the senator. 
he say. suppose a man ha write a book that will live for ever. 
i say. neither you nor i will ever live to see that man but we ll assume it. what then. 
he say. i want to protect the world against that man s heir and assign work under your theory. 
i say. you think that all the world ha no commercial sense. the book that will live for ever can t be artificially keep up at inflate price. there will always be very expensive edition of it and cheap one issue side by side. 
take the case of sir walter scott s novel mark twain continue turn to me. when the copyright note protect them i buy edition a expensive a i could afford because i like them. at the same time the same firm be sell edition that a cat might buy. they have their real estate and not be fool recognise that one portion of the plot could be work a a gold mine another a a vegetable garden and another a a marble quarry. do you see. 
what i saw with the great clearness be mark twain be force to fight for the simple proposition that a man ha a much right to the work of his brain. think of the heresy of it. a to the labour of his hand. when the old lion roar the young whelp growl. i growl assentingly and the talk run on from book in general to his own in particular. 
grow bold and feel that i have a few hundred thousand folk at my back i demand whether tom sawyer marry judge thatcher s daughter and whether we be ever go to hear of tom sawyer a a man. 
i haven t decide quoth mark twain get up fill his pipe and walk up and down the room in his slipper. i have a notion of write the sequel to tom sawyer in two way. in one i would make him rise to great honour and go to congress and in the other i should hang him. then the friend and enemy of the book could take their choice. 
here i lose my reverence completely and protest against any theory of the sort because to me at least tom sawyer be real. 
oh he be real say mark twain. he s all the boy that i have know or recollect. but that would be a good way of end the book. then turn round because when you come to think of it neither religion train nor education avail anything against the force of circumstance that drive a man. suppose we take the next four and twenty year of tom sawyer s life and give a little joggle to the circumstance that control him. he would logically and accord to the joggle turn out a rip or an angel. 
do you believe that then. 
i think so. isn t it what you call kismet. 
yes. but don t give him two joggle and show the result because he isn t your property any more. he belong to u. 
he laugh a large wholesome laugh and this begin a dissertation on the right of a man to do what he like with his own creation which be a matter of purely professional interest i will mercifully omit. 
return to the big chair he speak of truth and the like in literature say that an autobiography be the one work in which a man against his own will and in spite of his utmost strive to the contrary reveal himself in his true light to the world. 
a good deal of your life on the mississippi be autobiographical isn t it. i ask. 
a near a it can be when a man be write to a book and about himself. but in genuine autobiography i believe it be impossible for a man to tell the truth about himself or to avoid impress the reader with the truth about himself. 
i make an experiment once. i get a friend of mine a man painfully give to speak the truth on all occasion a man who wouldn t dream of tell a lie and i make him write his autobiography for his own amusement and mine. he do it. the manuscript would have make an octavo volume but good honest man that he be in every single detail of his life that i know about he turn out on paper a formidable liar. he could not help himself. 
it be not in human nature to write the truth about itself. none the le the reader get a general impression from an autobiography whether the man be a fraud or a good man. the reader can t give his reason any more than a man can explain why a woman strike him a be lovely when he doesn t remember her hair eye teeth or figure. and the impression that the reader get be a correct one. 
do you ever intend to write an autobiography. 
if i do it will be a other men have do with the most earnest desire to make myself out to be the good man in every little business that ha be to my discredit. and i shall fail like the others to make my reader believe anything except the truth. 
this naturally lead to a discussion on conscience. then say mark twain and his word be mighty and to be remember. 
your conscience be a nuisance. a conscience be like a child. if you pet it and play with it and let it have everything that it want it become spoil and intrude on all your amusement and most of your grief. treat your conscience a you would treat anything else. when it be rebellious spank it be severe with it argue with it prevent it from come to play with you at all hour and you will secure a good conscience. that be to say a properly train one. a spoil one simply destroy all the pleasure in life. i think i have reduce mine to order. at least i haven t hear from it for some time. perhaps i have kill it from over severity. it s wrong to kill a child but in spite of all i have say a conscience differ from a child in many way. perhaps it s best when it s dead. 
here he tell me a little such thing a a man may tell a strange of his early life and upbringing and in what manner he have be influence for good by the example of his parent. he speak always through his eye a light under the heavy eyebrow. anon cross the room with a step a light a a girl s to show me some book or other. then resume his walk up and down the room puff at the cob pipe. i would have give much for nerve enough to demand the gift of that pipe value five cent when new. i understand why certain savage tribe ardently desire the liver of brave men slay in combat. that pipe would have give me perhaps a hint of his keen insight into the soul of men. but he never lay it aside within steal reach. 
once indeed he put his hand on my shoulder. it be an investiture of the star of india blue silk trumpet and diamond stud jewel all complete. if hereafter in the change and chance of this mortal life i fall to cureless ruin i will tell the superintendent of the workhouse that mark twain once put his hand on my shoulder. and he shall give me a room to myself and a double allowance of pauper tobacco. 
i never read novel myself say he except when the popular persecution force me to when people plague me to know what i think of the last book that every one be read. 
and how do the late persecution affect you. 
robert. say he interrogatively. 
i nod. 
i read it of course for the workmanship. that make me think i have neglect novel too long that there might be a good many book a graceful in style somewhere on the shelf. so i begin a course of novel read. i have drop it now. it do not amuse me. but a regard robert the effect on me be exactly a though a singer of street ballad be to hear excellent music from a church organ. i didn t stop to ask whether the music be legitimate or necessary. i listen and i like what i hear. i be speak of the grace and beauty of the style. 
you see he go on every man ha his private opinion about a book. but that be my private opinion. if i have live in the begin of thing i should have look around the township to see what popular opinion think of the murder of abel before i openly condemn cain. i should have have my private opinion of course but i shouldn t have express it until i have felt the way. you have my private opinion about that book. i don t know what my public one be exactly. they win t upset the earth. 
he recurled himself into the chair and talk of other thing. 
i spend nine month of the year at hartford. i have long ago satisfy myself that there be no hope of do much work during those nine month. people come in and call. they call at all hour about everything in the world. one day i think i would keep a list of interruption. it begin this way. 
a man come and would see no one but mr. clemens. he be an agent for photogravure reproduction of salon picture. i very seldom use salon picture in my book. 
after that man another man who refuse to see any one but mr. clemens come to make me write to washington about something. i saw him. i saw a third man then a fourth. by this time it be noon. i have grow tire of keep the list. i wish to rest. 
but the fifth man be the only one of the crowd with a card of his own. he send up his card. ben koontz hannibal mo. i be raise in hannibal. ben be an old schoolmate of mine. consequently i throw the house wide open and rush with both hand out at a big fat heavy man who be not the ben i have ever know nor anything like him. 
but be it you ben. i say. you ve alter in the last thousand year. 
the fat man say. well i m not koontz exactly but i meet him down in missouri and he tell me to be sure and call on you and he give me his card and here he act the little scene for my benefit if you can wait a minute till i can get out the circular i m not koontz exactly but i m travel with the full line of rod you ever saw. 
and what happen. i ask breathlessly. 
i shut the door. he be not ben koontz exactly not my old school fellow but i have shake him by both hand in love and. i have be beard by a lightning rod man in my own house. 
a i be say i do very little work in hartford. i come here for three month every year and i work four or five hour a day in a study down the garden of that little house on the hill. of course i do not object to two or three interruption. when a man be in the full swing of his work these little thing do not affect him. eight or ten or twenty interruption retard composition. 
i be burn to ask him all manner of impertinent question a to which of his work he himself prefer and so forth. but stand in awe of his eye i dare not. he speak on and i listen grovel. 
it be a question of mental equipment that be on the carpet and i be still wonder whether he mean what he say. 
personally i never care for fiction or story book. what i like to read about be fact and statistic of any kind. if they be only fact about the raise of radish they interest me. just now for instance before you come in he point to an encyclop√¶dia on the shelf i be read an article about mathematics. perfectly pure mathematics. 
my own knowledge of mathematics stop at twelve time twelve but i enjoy that article immensely. i didn t understand a word of it. but fact or what a man belief to be fact be always delightful. that mathematical fellow believe in his fact. so do i. get your fact first and the voice dy away to an almost inaudible drone then you can distort em a much a you please. 
bear this precious advice in my bosom i leave. the great man assure me with gentle kindness that i have not interrupt him in the least. once outside the door i yearn to go back and ask some question it be easy enough to think of them now but his time be his own though his book belong to me. 
i should have ample time to look back to that meet across the graf of the day. but it be sad to think of the thing he have not speak about. 
in san francisco the men of the call tell me many legend of mark s apprenticeship in their paper five and twenty year ago. how he be a reporter delightfully incapable of report accord to the need of the day. he prefer so they say to coil himself into a heap and meditate until the last minute. then he would produce copy bear no sort of relationship to his legitimate work copy that make the editor swear horribly and the reader of the call ask for more. 
i should like to have hear mark s version of that with some story of his joyous and variegate past. he ha be journeyman printer. in those day he wander from the bank of the missouri even to philadelphia. pilot cub and full blow pilot soldier of the south. that be for three week only. private secretary to a lieutenant governor of nevada. that displease him. miner editor special correspondent in the sandwich island and the lord only know what else. if so experience a man could by any mean be make drink it would be a glorious thing to fill him up with composite liquor and in the language of his own country let him retrospect. but these eye will never see that orgy fit for the god. 
the city of dreadful night. 
the city of dreadful night. 
chapter i. 
jan. feb. 
a real live city. 
we be all backwoodsman and barbarian together we others dwell beyond the ditch in the out darkness of the mofussil. there be no such thing a commissioner and head of department in the world and there be only one city in india. bombay be too green too pretty and too stragglesome. and madras die ever so long ago. let u take off our hat to calcutta the many side the smoky the magnificent a we drive in over the hugli bridge in the dawn of a still february morning. we have leave india behind u at howrah station and now we enter foreign part. no not wholly foreign. say rather too familiar. 
all men of a certain age know the feel of cage irritation an illustration in the graphic_ a bar of music or the light word of a friend from home may set it ablaze that come from the knowledge of our lose heritage of london. at home they the other men our equal have at their disposal all that town can supply the roar of the street the light the music the pleasant place the million of their own kind and a wilderness full of pretty fresh colour englishwoman theatre and restaurant. it be their right. they accept it a such and even affect to look upon it with contempt. and we we have nothing except the few amusement that we painfully build up for ourselves the dolorous dissipation of gymkhana where every one know everybody else or the chasten intoxication of dance where all engagement be book in ink ten day ahead and where everybody s antecedent be a patent a his or her method of waltz. we have be deprive of our inheritance. the men at home be enjoy it all not know how fair and rich it be and we at the most can only fly westward for a few month and gorge what properly speak should take seven or eight or ten luxurious year. that be the lose heritage of london. and the knowledge of the forfeiture wilful or force come to most men at time and season and they get cross. 
calcutta hold out false hope of some return. the dense smoke hang low in the chill of the morning over an ocean of roof and a the city wake there go up to the smoke a deep full throated boom of life and motion and humanity. for this reason doe he who see calcutta for the first time hang joyously out of the ticca ghari_[ ] and sniff the smoke and turn his face toward the tumult say. this be at last some portion of my heritage return to me. this be a city. there be life here and there should be all manner of pleasant thing for the have across the river and under the smoke. 
[ ] hire carriage. 
the litany be an expressive one and exactly describe the first emotion of a wander savage adrift in calcutta. the eye ha lose it sense of proportion the focus ha contract through overmuch residence in up country station twenty minute canter from hospital to parade grind you know and the mind ha shrink with the eye. both say together a they take in the sweep of ship above and below the hugli bridge. why this be london. this be the dock. this be imperial. this be worth come across india to see. 
then a distinctly wicked idea take possession of the mind. what a divine what a heavenly place to loot. this give place to a much bad devil that of conservatism. it seem not only a wrong but a criminal thing to allow native to have any voice in the control of such a city adorn dock wharf front and reclaim by englishman exist only because england life and dependent for it life on england. all india know of the calcutta municipality. but ha any one thoroughly investigate the big calcutta stink. there be only one. benares be foul in point of concentrate pen up muck and there be local stench in peshawar which be strong than the b. c. s. but for diffuse soul sicken expansiveness the reek of calcutta beat both benares and peshawar. bombay cloak her stench with a veneer of assafoetida and tobacco. calcutta be above pretence. there be no trace back the calcutta plague to any one source. it be faint it be sickly and it be indescribable. but american at the great eastern hotel say that it be something like the smell of the chinese quarter in san francisco. it be certainly not an indian smell. it resemble the essence of corruption that ha rot for the second time the clammy odour of blue slime. and there be no escape from it. it blow across the maidan. it come in gust into the corridor of the great eastern hotel. what they be please to call the palace of chowringhi carry it. it swirl round the bengal club. it pour out of by street with sicken intensity and the breeze of the morning be lade with it. it be first find in spite of the fume of the engine in howrah station. it seem to be bad in the little lane at the back of lai bazar where the drink shop be but it be nearly a bad opposite government house and in the public office. the thing be intermittent. six moderately pure mouthful of air may be draw without offence. then come the seventh wave and the queasiness of an uncultured stomach. if you live long enough in calcutta you grow use to it. the regular resident admit the disgrace but their answer be. wait till the wind blow off the salt lake where all the sewage go and then you ll smell something. that be their defence. small wonder that they consider calcutta be a fit place for a permanent viceroy. englishman who can calmly extenuate one shame by another be capable of ask for anything and expect to get it. 
if an up country station hold three thousand troop and twenty civilian own such a possession a calcutta doe the deputy commissioner or the cantonment magistrate would have all the native off the board of management or decently shovel into the background until the mess be abate. then they might come on again and talk of high hand oppression a much a they like. that stink to an unprejudiced nose damn calcutta a a city of king. and in spite of that stink they allow they even encourage native to look after the place. the damp drainage soak soil be sick with the teem life of a hundred year and the municipal board list be choke with the name of native men of the breed bear in and raise off this surfeit muck heap. they own property these amiable aryan on the municipal and the bengal legislative council. launch a proposal to tax them on that property and they naturally howl. they also howl up country but there the hall for mass meeting be few and the vernacular paper few and with a strong secretary and a president whose favour be worth the have and whose wrath be undesirable men be keep clean despite themselves and may not poison their neighbour. why ask a savage let them vote at all. they can put up with this filthiness. they cannot have any feeling worth care a rush for. let them live quietly and hide away their money under our protection while we tax them till they know through their purse the measure of their neglect in the past and when a little of the smell ha be abolish let u bring them back again to talk and take the credit of enlightenment. the good class own their brougham and barouche. the bad can shoulder an englishman into the kennel and talk to him a though he be a cook. they can refer to an english lady a an aurat_[ ]. they be permit a freedom not to put it too coarsely of speech which if use by an englishman toward an englishman would end in serious trouble. they be fence and protect and make inviolate. surely they might be content with all those thing without enter into matter which they cannot by the nature of their birth understand. 
[ ] woman. 
now whether all this genial diatribe be the outcome of an unbiassed mind or the result first of sickness cause by that ferocious stench and secondly of headache due to day long smoke to drown the stench be an open question. anyway calcutta be a fearsome place for a man not educate up to it. 
a word of advice to other barbarian. do not bring a north country servant into calcutta. he be sure to get into trouble because he doe not understand the custom of the city. a punjabi in this place for the first time esteem it his bounden duty to go to the ajaib ghar the museum. such an one ha go and be even now return very angry and trouble in the spirit. i go to the museum say he and no one give me any abuse. i go to the market to buy my food and then i sit upon a seat. there come an orderly who say go away i want to sit here. i say i be here first. he say i be a chaprassi. [ ] get out. and he hit me. now that sit place be open to all so i hit him till he weep. he run away for the police and i go away too for the police here be all sahib. can i have leave from two o clock to go and look for that man and hit him again. 
[ ] messenger. 
behold the situation. an unknown city full of smell that make one long for rest and retirement and a champ servant not yet six hour in the stew who ha start a blood feud with an unknown chaprassi and clamour to go forth to the fray. 
ala. for the lose delusion of the heritage that be to be restore. let u sleep let u sleep and pray that calcutta may be good to morrow. 
at present it be remarkably like sleep with a corpse. 
chapter ii. 
the reflection of a savage. 
morning bring counsel. doe calcutta smell so pestiferously after all. heavy rain ha fall in the night. she be newly wash and the clear sunlight show her at her best. where oh where in all this wilderness of life shall a man go. 
the great eastern hum with life through all it hundred room. door slam merrily and all the nation of the earth run up and down the staircase. this alone be refresh because the passer bump you and ask you to stand aside. fancy find any place outside the lev√©e room where englishman be crowd together to this extent. fancy sit down seventy strong to t√¢ble d h√¥te and with a deafen clatter of knife and fork. fancy find a real bar whence drink may be obtain. and joy of joy fancy step out of the hotel into the arm of a live white helmeted button truncheoned bobby. what would happen if one speak to this bobby. would he be offend. he be not offend. he be affable. he ha to patrol the pavement in front of the great eastern and to see that the crowd carriage do not jam. toward a presumably respectable white he behave a a man and a brother. there be no arrogance about him. and this be disappoint. close inspection show that he be not a real bobby after all. he be a municipal police something and his uniform be not correct. at least if they have not change the dress of the men at home. but no matter. late on we will inquire into the calcutta bobby because he be a white man and ha to deal with some of the tough folk that ever set out of malice aforethought to paint job charnock s city vermilion. you must not you cannot cross old court house street without look carefully to see that you stand no chance of be run over. this be beautiful. there be a steady roar of traffic cut every two minute by the deep roll of the tram. the drive be eccentric not to say bad but there be the traffic more than unsophisticated eye have behold for a certain number of year. it mean business it mean money make it mean crowd and hurry life and it get into the blood and make it move. here be big shop with plate glass front all display the well know name of firm that we savage only correspond with through the parcel post. [ ] they be all here a large a life ready to supply anything you need if you only care to sign. great be the fascination of be able to obtain a thing on the spot without have to write for a week and wait for a month and then get something quite different. no wonder pretty lady who live anywhere within a reasonable distance come down to do their shop personally. 
[ ] c. o. d. 
look here. if you want to be respectable you mustn t smoke in the street. nobody doe it. this be advice kindly tender by a friend in a black coat. there be no lev√©e or lieutenant governor in sight. but he wear the frock coat because it be daylight and he can be see. he refrain from smoke for the same reason. he admit that providence build the open air to be smoke in but he say that it isn t the thing. this man ha a brougham a remarkably natty little pill box with a curious wabble about the wheel. he step into the brougham and put on a top hat a shiny black plug. 
there be a man up country once who own a top hat. he lease it to amateur theatrical company for some season until the nap wear off. then he throw it into a tree and wild bee hive in it. men be wont to come and look at the hat in it palmy day for the sake of feel homesick. it interest all the station and die with two seer of babul flower honey in it bosom. but top hat be not intend to be wear in india. they be a sacred a home letter and old rosebud. the friend cannot see this. he allow that if he step out of his brougham and walk about in the sunshine for ten minute he would get a bad headache. in half an hour he would probably die of sunstroke. he allow all this but he keep to his hat and cannot see why a barbarian be move to inextinguishable laughter at the sight. every one who own a brougham and many people who hire ticca gharis keep top hat and black frock coat. the effect be curious and at first fill the beholder with surprise. 
and now let u see the handsome house where the wealthy noble dwell. northerly lie the great human jungle of the native city stretch from burra bazar to chitpore. that can keep. southerly be the maidan and chowringhi. if you get out into the centre of the maidan you will understand why calcutta be call the city of palace. the travel american say so at the great eastern. there be a short tower falsely call a memorial stand in a waste of soft sour green. that be a good a place to get to a any other. the size of the maidan take the heart out of any one accustom to the garden of up country just a they say newmarket heath cow a horse accustom to more a shut in course. the huge level be stud with brazen statue of eminent gentleman rid fretful horse on diabolically severe curb. the expanse dwarf the statue dwarf everything except the frontage of the far away chowringhi road. it be big it be impressive. there be no escape the fact. they build house in the old day when the rupee be two shilling and a penny. those house be three storied and ornament with service staircase like house in the hill. they be very close together and they have garden wall of masonry pierce with a single gate. in their shut upness they be british. in their spaciousness they be oriental but those service staircase do not look healthy. we will form an amateur sanitary commission and call upon chowringhi. 
a first introduction to the calcutta durw√¢n or door keeper be not nice. if he be chew p√¢n_ he doe not take the trouble to get rid of his quid. if he be sit on his cot chew sugar cane he doe not think it worth his while to rise. he ha to be teach those thing and he cannot understand why he should be reprove. clearly he be a survival of a play out system. providence never intend that any native should be make a concierge more insolent than any of the french variety. the people of calcutta put a man in a little lodge close to the gate of their house in order that loafer may be turn away and the house protect from theft. the natural result be that the durw√¢n treat everybody whom he doe not know a a loafer ha an intimate and vendible knowledge of all the outgo and incoming in that house and control to a large extent the nomination of the servant. they say that one of the estimable class be now sue a bank for about three lakh of rupee. [ ] up country a lieutenant governor s servant ha to work for thirty year before he can retire on seventy thousand rupee of saving. the calcutta durw√¢n be a great institution. the head and front of his offence be that he will insist upon try to talk english. how he protect the house calcutta only know. he can be frighten out of his wit by severe speech and be generally asleep in call hour. if a rough round of visit be any guide three time out of seven he be fragrant of drink. so much for the durw√¢n. now for the house he guard. 
[ ] say $. 
very pleasant be the sensation of be usher into a pestiferously stablesome draw room. doe this always happen. no not unless you shut up the room for some time. but if you open the shutter there be other smell. you see the stable and the servant quarter be close to. people pay five hundred a month for half a dozen room fill with scent of this kind. they make no complaint. when they think the honour of the city be at stake they say defiantly. yes but you must remember we re a metropolis. we be crowd here. we have no room. we aren t like your little station. chowringhi be a stately place full of sumptuous house but it be best to look at it hastily. stop to consider for a moment what the cramp compound the black soak soil the net intricacy of the service staircase the pack stable the seethment of human life round the durw√¢ns lodge and the curious arrangement of little open drain mean and you will call it a white sepulchre. 
men live in expensive tenement suffer from chronic sore throat and will tell you cheerily that we ve get typhoid in calcutta now. be the pest ever out of it. everything seem to be build with a view to it comfort. it can lodge comfortably on roof climb along from the gutter pipe to piazza or rise from sink to verandah and thence to the topmost story. but calcutta say that all be sound and produce figure to prove it. at the same time admit that healthy cut flesh will not readily heal. further evidence may be dispense with. 
here come pour down park street on the maid√¢n a rush of brougham neat buggy the light of gig trim office brownberrys shin victoria and a sprinkle of veritable hansom cab. in the brougham sit men in top hat. in the other cart young men all very much alike and all immaculately turn out. a fresh stream from chowringhi join the park street detachment and the two together stream away across the maid√¢n toward the business quarter of the city. this be calcutta go to office the civilian to the government building and the young men to their firm and their block and their wharf. here one see that calcutta ha the best turn out in the empire. horse and trap alike be enviably perfect and mark the touchstone of civilization the lamp be in their socket. the country breed be a rare beast here. his place be take by the waler [ ] and the waler though a ruffian at heart can be make to look like a gentleman. it would be indecorous to applaud the wink harness the perfectly lacquer panel and the liveried saises. they show well in the outwardly fair road shadow by the palace. 
[ ] import australian horse. 
how many section of the complex society of the place do the cart carry. first_ the bengal civilian who go to writer building and sit in a perfect office and speak flippantly of send thing to india mean thereby refer matter to the supreme government. he be a great person and his mouth be full of promotion and appointment shop. generally he be refer to a a rise man. calcutta seem full of rise men. secondly_ the government of india man who wear a familiar simla face rent a flat when he be not up in the hill and be rational on the subject of the drawback of calcutta. thirdly_ the man of the firm the pure non official who fight under the banner of one of the great house of the city or for his own hand in a neat office or dash about clive street in a brougham do share work or something of the kind. he fear not bengal nor regard he india. he swear impartially at both when their action interfere with his operation. his shop be quite unintelligible. he be like the english city man with the chill off life well and entertain hospitably. in the old day he be great than he be now but still he bulk large. he be rational in so far that he will help the abuse of the municipality but womanish in his insistence on the excellency of calcutta. over and above these who be hurry to work be the various brigade squad and detachment of the other interest. but they be set and not section and revolve round belvedere government house and fort william. simla and darjeeling claim them in the hot weather. let them go. they wear top hat and frock coat. 
it be time to escape from chowringhi road and get among the long shore folk who have no prejudice against tobacco and who all use very much the same sort of hat. 
chapter iii. 
the council of the god. 
he set up conclusion to the number of nine thousand seven hundred and sixty four. he go afterwards to the sorbonne where he maintain argument against the theologian for the space of six week from four o clock in the morning till six in the even except for an interval of two hour to refresh themselves and take their repast and at this be present the great part of the lord of the court the master of request president counsellor those of the accompts secretary advocate and others. a also the sheriff of the say town. pantagruel. 
the bengal legislative council be sit now. you will find it in an octagonal wing of writer building. straight across the maid√¢n. it s worth see. what be they sit on. municipal business. no end of a debate. so much for try to keep low company. the long shore loafer must stand over. without doubt this council be go to hang some one for the state of the city and sir steuart bayley will be chief executioner. one doe not come across council every day. 
writer building be large. you can trouble the busy worker of half a dozen department before you stumble upon the black stain staircase that lead to an upper chamber look out over a populous street. wild orderly block the way. the councillor sahib be sit but any one can enter. to the right of the l√¢t sahib s chair and go quietly. ill mannered minion. doe he expect the awe stricken spectator to prance in with a war whoop or turn catherine wheel round that sumptuous octagonal room with the blue domed roof. there be gild capital to the half pillar and an egyptian pattern lotus stencil make the wall gay. a thick pile carpet cover all the floor and must be delightful in the hot weather. on a black wooden throne comfortably cushion in green leather sit sir steuart bayley ruler of bengal. the rest be all great men or else they would not be there. not to know them argue oneself unknown. there be a dozen of them and sit six aside at two slightly curve line of beautifully polish desk. thus sir steuart bayley occupy the frog of a badly make horse shoe split at the toe. in front of him at a table cover with book and pamphlet and paper toil a secretary. there be a seat for the reporter and that be all. the place enjoy a chasten gloom and it very atmosphere fill one with awe. this be the heart of bengal and uncommonly well upholster. if the work match the first class furniture the inkpot the carpet and the resplendent ceiling there will be something worth see. but where be the criminal who be to be hang for the stench that run up and down writer building staircase. for the rubbish heap in the chitpore road. for the sickly savour of chowringhi. for the dirty little tank at the back of belvedere. for the street full of small pox. for the reek ghari stand outside the great eastern. for the state of the stone and dirt pavement. for the condition of the gully of shampooker and for a hundred other thing. 
this i submit be an artificial scheme in supersession of nature s unit the individual. the speaker be a slight spare native in a flat hat turban and a black alpaca frock coat. he look like a scribe to the boot heel and with his unvarying smile and regulate gesticulation recall memory of up country court. he never hesitate be never at a loss for a word and never in one sentence repeat himself. he talk and talk and talk in a level voice rise occasionally half an octave when a point ha to be drive home. some of his period sound very familiar. this for instance might be a sentence from the indian mirror. so much for the principle. let u now examine how far it be support by precedent. this sound bad. when a fluent native be discourse of principle and precedent the chance be that he will go on for some time. moreover where be the criminal and what be all this talk about abstraction. they want shovel not sentiment in this part of the world. 
a friendly whisper bring enlightenment. they be plough through the calcutta municipal bill plurality of vote you know. here be the paper. and so it be. a mass of motion and amendment on matter relate to ward vote. be a to be allow to give two vote in one ward and one in another. be section to be omit and be one man to be allow one vote and no more. how many vote doe three hundred rupee worth of land property carry. be it good to kiss a post or throw it in the fire. not a word about carbolic acid and gang of sweeper. the little man in the black dress gown revel in his subject. he be great on principle and precedent and the necessity of popularise our system. he fear that under certain circumstance the status of the candidate will decline. he riot in self adjust majority and the healthy influence of the educate middle class. 
for a practical answer to this there steal across the council chamber just one faint whiff of the stink. it be a though some one laugh low and bitterly. but no man heed. the englishman look supremely bore the native member stare stolidly in front of them. sir steuart bayley s face be a set a the face of the sphinx. for these thing he draw his pay a low wage for heavy labour. but the speaker now adrift be not altogether to be blame. he be a bengali who ha get before him just such a subject a his soul loveth an elaborate piece of academical reform lead nowhere. here be a quiet room full of pen and paper and there be men who must listen to him. apparently there be no time limit to the speech. can you wonder that he talk. he say i submit once every ninety second vary the form with i do submit the popular element in the electoral body should have prominence. quite so. he quote one john stuart mill to prove it. there steal over the listener a numb sense of nightmare. he ha hear all this before somewhere yea. even down to j. s. mill and the reference to the true interest of the ratepayer. he see what be come next. yes there be the old sabha anjuman journalistic formula western education be an exotic plant of recent importation. how on earth do this man drag western education into this discussion. who know. perhaps sir steuart bayley doe. he seem to be listen. the others be look at their watch. the spell of the level voice sink the listener yet deep into a trance. he be haunt by the ghost of all the cant of all the political platform of great britain. he hear all the old old vestry phrase and once more he smell the smell. that be no dream. western education be an exotic plant. it be the upas tree and it be all our fault. we bring it out from england exactly a we bring out the ink bottle and the pattern for the chair. we plant it and it grow monstrous a a banian. now we be choke by the root of it spread so thickly in this fat soil of bengal. the speaker continue. bite by bite we build this dome visible and invisible the crown of writer building a we have build and people the building. now we have go too far to retreat be tie and bind with the chain of our own sin. the speech continue. we make that florid sentence. that torrent of verbiage be ours. we teach him what be constitutional and what be unconstitutional in the day when calcutta smelt. calcutta smell still but we must listen to all that he ha to say about the plurality of vote and the thresh of wind and the weave of rope of sand. it be our own fault. 
the speech end and there rise a grey englishman in a black frock coat. he look a strong man and a worldly. surely he will say yes lala sahib all this may be true talk but there s a vile smell in this place and everything must be clean in a week or the deputy commissioner will not take any notice of you in durbar. he say nothing of the kind. this be a legislative council where they call each other honourable so and so s. the englishman in the frock coat beg all to remember that we be discuss principle and no consideration of the detail ought to influence the verdict on the principle. be he then like the rest. how doe this strange thing come about. perhaps these so english office fitting be responsible for the warp. the council chamber might be a london board room. perhaps after long year among the pen and paper it occupant grow to think that it really be and in this belief give r√©sum√©s of the history of local self government in england. 
the black frock coat emphasise his point with his spectacle case be tell his friend how the parish be first the unit of self government. he then explain how burgess be elect and in tone of deep fervour announce commissioner of sewer be elect in the same way. whereunto all this lecture. be he try to run a motion through under cover of a cloud of word essay the well know cuttle fish trick of the west. 
he abandon england for a while and now we get a glimpse of the cleave hoof in a casual reference to hindu and mahometans. the hindu will lose nothing by the complete establishment of plurality of vote. they will have the control of their own ward a they use to have. so there be race feel to be explain away even among these beautiful desk. scratch the council and you come to the old old trouble. the black frock coat sit down and a keen eye black beard englishman rise with one hand in his pocket to explain his view on an alteration of the vote qualification. the idea of an amendment seem to have just strike him. he hint that he will bring it forward late on. he be academical like the others but not half so good a speaker. all this be dreary beyond word. why do they talk and talk about owner and occupier and burgess in england and the growth of autonomous institution when the city the great city be here cry out to be cleanse. what ha england to do with calcutta s evil and why should englishman be force to wander through maze of unprofitable argument against men who cannot understand the iniquity of dirt. 
a pause follow the black beard man s speech. rise another native a heavily build babu in a black gown and a strange head dress. a snowy white strip of cloth be throw duster wise over his shoulder. his voice be high and not always under control. he begin i will try to be a brief a possible. this be ominous. by the way in council there seem to be no necessity for a form of address. the orator plunge in medias res_ and only when they be well launch throw an occasional sir towards sir steuart bayley who sit with one leg double under him and a dry pen in his hand. this speaker be no good. he talk but he say nothing and he only know where he be drift to. he say. we must remember that we be legislate for the metropolis of india and therefore we should borrow our institution from large english town and not from parochial institution. if you think for a minute that show a large and healthy knowledge of the history of local self government. it also reveal the attitude of calcutta. if the city think le about itself a a metropolis and more a a midden it state would be good. the speaker talk patronisingly of my friend allude to the black frock coat. then he flounder afresh and his voice gallop up the gamut a he declare and therefore that make all the difference. he hint vaguely at threat something to do with the hindu and the mahometans but what he mean it be difficult to discover. here however be a sentence take verbatim. it be not likely to appear in this form in the calcutta paper. the black frock coat have say that if a wealthy native have eight vote to his credit his vanity would prompt him to go to the poll booth because he would feel good than half a dozen ghari wan or petty trader. fancy allow a ghari wan to vote. he ha yet to learn how to drive. hereon the gentleman with the white cloth. then the complaint be that influential voter will not take the trouble to vote. in my humble opinion if that be so adopt vote paper. that be the way to meet them. in the same way the calcutta trade association you abolish all plurality of vote. and that be the way to meet them. lucid be it not. up fly the irresponsible voice and deliver this statement in the election for the house of common plurality be allow for person have interest in different district. then hopeless hopeless fog. it be a great pity that india ever hear of anybody high than the head of the civil service. once more a whiff of the stink. the gentleman give a defiant jerk of his shoulder cloth and sit down. 
then sir steuart bayley. the question before the council be etc. there be a ripple of ayes and no and the no have it whatever it may be. the black beard gentleman spring his amendment about the vote qualification. a large senator in a white waistcoat and with a most genial smile rise and proceed to smash up the amendment. can t see the use of it. call it in effect rubbish. the black dress gown he who speak first of all speak again and talk of the sojourner who come here for a little time and then leaf the land. well it be for the black gown that the sojourner doe come or there would be no comfy place wherein to talk about the power that can be measure by wealth and the intellect which sir i submit cannot be so measure. the amendment be lose. and trebly and quadruply lose be the listener. in the name of sanity and to preserve the tattered shirt tail of a tear illusion let u escape. this be the calcutta municipal bill. they have be at it for several saturday. last saturday sir steuart bayley point out that at their present rate they would be about two year in get it through. now they will sit till dusk unless sir steuart bayley who want to see lord connemara off put up the black frock coat to move an adjournment. it be not good to watch a government close to. this lead to the formation of blatantly self satisfy judgment which may be quite a wrong a the cramp system with which we have encompass ourselves. and in the street outside englishman summarise the situation brutally thus. the whole thing be a farce. time be money to u. we can t stick out those everlasting speech in the municipality. the native choke u off but we know that if thing get too bad the government will step in and interfere and so we worry along somehow. 
meantime calcutta continue to cry out for the bucket and the broom. 
chapter iv. 
on the bank of the hugli. 
the clock of the city have strike two. where can a man get food. calcutta be not rich in respect of dainty accommodation. you can stay your stomach at peliti s or bonsard s but their shop be not to be find in hastings street or in the place where broker fly to and fro in office jauns sweat and grow visibly rich. there must be some sort of entertainment where sailor congregate. honest bombay jack supply nothing but burma cheroot and whisky in liqueur glass but in lal bazar not far from the sailor coffee room a board give bold advertisement that officer and seaman can find good quarter. in evidence a row of neat officer and seaman be sit on a bench by the hotel door smoke. there be an almost military liken in their clothe. perhaps honest bombay jack only keep one kind of felt hat and one brand of suit. when jack of the mercantile marine be sober he be very sober. when he be drink he be but ask the river police what a lean mad yankee can do with his nail and teeth. these gentleman smoke on the bench be impassive almost a red indian. their attitude be unrestrained and they do not wear brace. nor it would appear from the bill of fare be they particular a to what they eat when they attend t√¢ble d h√¥te. the fare be substantial and the regulation peg every house ha it own depth of peg if you will refrain from stop ganymede something to wonder at. three finger and a trifle over seem to be the use of the officer and seaman who be talk so quietly in the doorway. one say he ha evidently finish a long story and so he ship for four pound ten with a first mate s certificate and all. and that be in a german barque. another spit with conviction and say genially without raise his voice that be a hell of a ship. who know her. no answer from the assembly but a dane or a german want to know whether the myra be up yet. a dry red haired man give her exact position in the river. how in the world can he know. and the probable hour of her arrival. the grave debate drift into a discussion of a recent river accident whereby a big steamer be damage and have to put back and discharge cargo. a burly gentleman who be take a constitutional down lal bazar stroll up and say. i tell you she foul her own chain with her own forefoot. hev you see the plate. no. then how the can any like you say what it well be. he pass on have deliver his highly flavor opinion without heat or passion. no one seem to resent the garnish. 
let u get down to the river and see this stamp of men more thoroughly. clarke russell ha tell u that their life be hard enough in all conscience. what be their pleasure and diversion. the port office where live the gentleman who make improvement in the port of calcutta ought to supply information. it stand large and fair and build in an orientalise manner after the italian at the corner of fairlie place upon the great strand road and a continual clamour of traffic by land and by sea go up throughout the day and far into the night against it window. this be a place to enter more reverently than the bengal legislative council for it control the direction of the uncertain hugli down to the sandheads own enormous wealth and spend huge sum on the frontaging of river bank the expansion of jetty and the manufacture of dock cost two hundred lakh of rupee. two million ton of sea go shippage yearly find their way up and down the river by the guidance of the port office and the men of the port office know more than it be good for men to hold in their head. they can without reference to telegraphic bulletin give the position of all the big steamer come up or go down from the hugli to the sea day by day with their tonnage the name of their captain and the nature of their cargo. look out from the verandah of their office over a lancer regiment of mast they can declare truthfully the name of every ship within eye scope with the day and hour when she will depart. 
in a room at the bottom of the build lounge big men carefully dress. now there be a type of face which belong almost exclusively to bengal cavalry officer major for choice. everybody know the bronze black moustached clear speak native cavalry officer. he exist unnaturally in novel and naturally on the frontier. these men in the big room have his cast of face so strongly mark that one marvel what officer be do by the river. have they come to book passage for home. those men. they re pilot. some of them draw between two and three thousand rupee a month. they be responsible for half a million pound worth of cargo sometimes. they certainly be men and they carry themselves a such. they confer together by two and three and appeal frequently to ship list. 
_isn t a pilot a man who always wear a pea jacket and shout through a speak trumpet. well you can ask those gentleman if you like. you ve get your notion from home pilot. ours aren t that kind exactly. they be a pick service a carefully weed a the indian civil. some of em have brother in it and some belong to the old indian army family. but they be not all equally well pay. the calcutta paper echo the groan of the junior pilot who be not allow the handle of ship over a certain tonnage. a it be yearly grow cheap to build one big steamer than two little one these junior be crowd out and while the senior get their thousand some of the youngster make at the end of one month exactly thirty rupee. this be a grievance with them and it seem well found. 
in the flat above the pilot s room be hush and chapel like office all sumptuously fit where englishman write and telephone and telegraph and deft babu for ever draw map of the shift hugli. any hope of understand the work of the port commissioner be thoroughly dash by be take through the port map of a quarter of a century past. men have play with the hugli a child play with a gutter runnel and in return the hugli once rise and play with men and ship till the strand road be litter with the raffle and the carcass of big ship. there be photo on the wall of the cyclone of when the thunder come inland and sit upon an american barque obstruct all the traffic. very curious be these photo and almost impossible to believe. how can a big strong steamer have her three mast raze to deck level. how can a heavy country boat be pitch on to the poop of a high wall liner. and how can the side be bodily tear out of a ship. the photo say that all these thing be possible and men aver that a cyclone may come again and scatter the craft like chaff. outside the port office be the export and import shed building that can hold a ship s cargo apiece all stand on reclaim grind. here be several strong smell a mass of railway line and a multitude of men. do you see where that trolly be stand behind the big p. and o. berth. in that place a nearly a may be the govindpur go down about twenty year ago and begin to shift out. but that be solid grind. she sink there and the next tide make a scour hole on one side of her. the return tide knock her into it. then the mud make up behind her. next tide the business be repeat always the scour hole in the mud and the fill up behind her. so she roll and be push out and out until she get in the way of the ship right out yonder and we have to blow her up. when a ship sink in mud or quicksand she regularly dig her own grave and wriggle herself into it deep and deep till she reach moderately solid stuff. then she stick. horrible idea be it not to go down and down with each tide into the foul hugli mud. 
close to the port office be the ship office where the captain engage their crew. the men must produce their discharge from their last ship in the presence of the ship master or a they call him the deputy ship. he pass them after have satisfy himself that they be not deserter from other ship and they then sign article for the voyage. this be the ceremony begin with the dearly beloved of the crew hunt captain down to the amazement of the deserter. there be a dingy build next door to the sailor home at whose gate stand the cast up of all the sea in all manner of raiment. there be the seedee boy bombay serangs and madras fisherman of the salt village malay who insist upon marry calcutta woman grow jealous and run amok. malay hindu hindu malay white burmese burma white burma native white italian with gold earring and a thirst for gamble yankee of all the state with mulatto and pure buck nigger red and rough dane cingalese cornish boy fresh take from the plough tail corn stalk from colonial ship where they get four pound ten a month a seaman tun belly german cockney mate keep a little aloof from the crowd and talk in knot together unmistakable tommies who have tumble into seafaring life by some mistake cockatoo tufted welshman spit and swear like cat break down loafer grey head penniless and pitiful swagger boy and very quiet men with gash and cut on their face. it be an ethnological museum where all the specimen be play comedy and tragedy. the head of it all be the deputy ship and he sit support by an english policeman whose fist be knobby in a great chair of state. the deputy ship know all the iniquity of the river side all the ship all the captain and a fair amount of the men. he be fence off from the crowd by a strong wooden rail behind which be gather the unemployed of the mercantile marine. they have have their spree poor devil and now they will go to sea again on a low a wage a three pound ten a month to fetch up at the end in some shanghai stew or san francisco hell. they have turn their back on the seduction of the howrah board house and the delight of colootollah. if fate will nightingale s will know them no more for a season. but what skipper will take some of these batter shatter wreck whose hand shake and whose eye be red. 
enter suddenly a beard captain who ha make his selection from the crowd on a previous day and now want to get his men pass. he be not fastidious in his choice. his eleven seem a tough lot for such a mild eye civil speak man to manage. but the captain in the ship office and the captain on his ship be two different thing. he bring his crew up to the deputy ship s bar and hand in their greasy tattered discharge. but the heart of the deputy ship be hot within him because two day ago a howrah crimp steal a whole crew from a down drop ship insomuch that the captain have to come back and whip up a new crew at one o clock in the day. evil will it be if the deputy ship find one of these bounty jumper in the choose crew of the blenkindoon. 
the deputy ship tell the story with heat. i didn t know they do such thing in calcutta say the captain. do such thing. they d steal the eye teeth out of your head there captain. he pick up a discharge and call for michael donelly a loose knit vicious look irish american who chew. stand up man stand up. michael donelly want to lean against the desk and the english policeman win t have it. what be your last ship. _fairy queen. when do you leave her. bout leven day. captain s name. flahy. that ll do. next man. jules anderson. jules anderson be a dane. his statement tally with the discharge certificate of the unite state a the eagle attesteth. he be pass and fall back. slivey the englishman and david a huge plum colour negro who ship a cook be also pass. then come bassompra a little italian who speak english. what s your last ship. _ferdinand. no after that. german barque. bassompra doe not look happy. when do she sail. about three week ago. what s her name. _haid√©e. you desert from her. yes but she s leave port. the deputy ship run rapidly through a ship list throw it down with a bang. twon t do. no german barque haid√©e here for three month. how do i know you don t belong to the jackson s crew. cap en i m afraid you ll have to ship another man. he must stand over. take the rest away and make em sign. 
the bead eye bassompra seem to have lose his chance of a voyage and his case will be inquire into. the captain depart with his men and they sign article for the voyage while the deputy ship tell strange tale of the sailorman s life. they ll quit a good ship for the sake of a spree and catch on again at three pound ten and by jove they ll let their skipper pay em at ten rupee to the sovereign poor beggar. a soon a the money s go they ll ship but not before. every one under rank of captain engage here. the competition make first mate ship sometimes for five pound or a low a four ten a month. the gentleman in the board house be right you see. a first mate s wage be seven ten or eight and foreign captain ship for twelve pound a month and bring their own small store everything that be to say except beef pea flour coffee and molasses. 
these thing be not pleasant to listen to while the hungry eye men in the bad clothe lounge and scratch and loaf behind the rail. what come to them in the end. they die it seem though that be not altogether strange. they die at sea in strange and horrible way. they die a few of them in the kintals be lose and suffocate in the great sink of calcutta. they die in strange place by the water side and the hugli take them away under the moor chain and the buoy and cast them up on the sand below if the river police have miss the capture. they sail the sea because they must live. and there be no end to their toil. very very few find haven of any kind and the earth whose way they do not understand be cruel to them when they walk upon it to drink and be merry after the manner of beast. jack ashore be a pretty thing when he be in a book or in the blue jacket of the navy. mercantile jack be not so lovely. late on we will see where his spree lead him. 
chapter v. 
with the calcutta police. 
the city be of night perchance of death but certainly of night. 
the city of dreadful night. 
in the begin the police be responsible. they say in a patronise way that they would prefer to take a wanderer round the great city themselves sooner than let him contract a break head on his own account in the slum. they say that there be place and place where a white man unsupported by the arm of the law would be rob and mob. and that there be other place where drunken seaman would make it very unpleasant for him. 
come up to the fire look out in the first place and then you ll be able to see the city. this be at no. lal bazar which be the headquarter of the calcutta police the centre of the great web of telephone wire where justice sit all day and all night look after one million people and a float population of one hundred thousand. but her work shall be deal with late on. the fire look out be a little sentry box on the top of the three storied police office. here a native watchman wait to give warn to the brigade below if the smoke rise by day or the flame by night in any ward of the city. from this eyrie in the warm night one hear the heart of calcutta beat. northward the city stretch away three long mile with three more mile of suburb beyond to dum dum and barrackpore. the lamplit dusk on this side be full of noise and shout and smell. close to the police office jovial mariner at the sailor coffee shop be roar hymn. southerly the city s confuse light give place to the orderly lamp row of the maid√¢n and chowringhi where the respectability live and the police have very little to do. from the east go up to the sky the clamour of sealdah the rumble of the tram and the voice of all bow bazar chaffer and make merry. westward be the business quarter hush now. the lamp of the ship on the river. and the twinkle light on the howrah side. doe the noise of traffic go on all through the hot weather. of course. the hot month be the busy in the year and money s tight. you should see the broker cut about at that season. calcutta can t stop my dear sir. what happen then. nothing happen. the death rate go up a little. that s all. even in february the weather would up country be call muggy and stifle but calcutta be convince that it be her cold season. the noise of the city grow perceptibly. it be the night side of calcutta wake up and go abroad. jack in the sailor coffee shop be sing joyously. shall we gather at the river the beautiful the beautiful the river. there be a clatter of hoof in the courtyard below. some of the mount police have come in from somewhere or other out of the great darkness. a clog dance of iron hoof follow and an englishman s voice be hear soothe an agitate horse who seem to be stand on his hind leg. some of the mount police be go out into the great darkness. what s on. a dance at government house. the reserve men be be form up below. they re call the roll. the reserve men be all english and big english at that. they form up and tramp out of the courtyard to line government place and see that mr. lollipop s brougham doe not get smash up by sirdar chuckerbutty bahadur s lumber c spring barouche with the two raw walers. very military men be the calcutta european police in their set up and he who know their composition know some startle story of gentleman ranker and the like. they be despite the wear climate they work in and the wear work they do a fine a five score of englishman a you shall find east of suez. 
listen for a moment from the fire look out to the voice of the night and you will see why they must be so. two thousand sailor of fifty nationality be adrift in calcutta every sunday and of these perhaps two hundred be distinctly the bad for liquor. there be a mild row go on even now somewhere at the back of bow bazar which at nightfall fill with sailormen who have a wonderful gift of fall foul of the native population. to keep the queen s peace be of course only a small portion of police duty but it be try. the burly president of the lock up for european drunk calcutta central lock up be worth see rejoice in a sprain thumb just now and ha to do his work leave hand in consequence. but his leave hand be a marvellously persuasive one and when on duty his sleeve be turn up to the shoulder that the jovial mariner may see that there be no deception. the president s labour be handicap in that the road of sin to the lock up run through a grimy little garden the brick path be wear deep with the tread of many drunken foot where a man can give a great deal of trouble by stick his toe into the grind and get mix up with the shrub. a straight run in would be much more convenient both for the president and the drink. generally speak and here police experience be pretty much the same all over the civilise world a woman drink be a good deal bad than a man drink. she scratch and bite like a chinaman and swear like several fiend. strange people may be unearth in the lock up. here be a perfectly true story not three week old. a visitor an unofficial one wander into the native side of the spacious accommodation provide for those who have go or do wrong. a wild eye babu rise from the fix charpoy and say in the best of english good morning sir. _good morning. who be you and what be you in for. then the babu in one breath. i would have you know that i do not go to prison a a criminal but a a reformer. you ve read the vicar of wakefield. ye e. well i be the vicar of bengal at least that s what i call myself. the visitor collapse. he have not nerve enough to continue the conversation. then say the voice of the authority. he s down in connection with a cheat case at serampore. may be sham insane but he ll be look to in time. 
the best place to hear about the police be the fire look out. from that eyrie one can see how difficult must be the work of control over the great growl beast of a city. by all mean let u abuse the police but let u see what the poor wretch have to do with their three thousand native and one hundred englishman. from howrah and bally and the other suburb at least a hundred thousand people come in to calcutta for the day and leave at night. then too chandernagore be handy for the fugitive law breaker who can enter in the even and get away before the noon of the next day have mark his house and break into it. 
but how can the prevalent offence be house break in a place like this. easily enough. when you ve see a little of the city you ll see. native sleep and lie about all over the place and whole quarter be just so many rabbit warren. wait till you see the machua bazar. well besides the petty theft and burglary we have heavy case of forgery and fraud that leave u with our wit pit against a bengali s. when a bengali criminal be work a fraud of the sort he love he be about the clever soul you could wish for. he give u case a year long to unravel. then there be the murder in the low house very curious thing they be. you ll see the house where sheikh babu be murder presently and you ll understand. the burra bazar and jora bagan section be the two bad one for heavy case. but colootollah be the most aggravate. there s colootollah over yonder that patch of darkness beyond the light. that section be full of tuppenny ha penny petty case that keep the men up all night and make em swear. you ll see colootollah and then perhaps you ll understand. bamun bustee be the quiet of all and lal bazar and bow bazar a you can see for yourself be the rowdy. you ve no notion what the native come to the police station for. a man will come on and want a summon against his master for refuse him half an hour s leave. i suppose it doe seem rather revolutionary to an up country man but they try to do it here. now wait a minute before we go down into the city and see the fire brigade turn out. business be slack with them just now but you time em and see. an order be give and a bell strike softly thrice. there be a rush of men the click of a bolt a red fire engine spit and swear with the spark fly from the furnace be drag out of it shelter. a huge brake which hold supplementary horse men and hatchet follow and a hose cart be the third on the list. the men push the heavy thing about a though they be pith toy. the men clamber up some one say softly all ready there and with an angry whistle the fire engine follow by the other two fly out into lal bazar. time min. sec. they ll find out it s a false alarm and come back again in five minute. why. because there will be no constable on the road to give em the direction of the fire and because the driver wasn t tell the ward of the outbreak when he go out. do you mean to say that you can from this absurd pigeon loft locate the ward in the night time. what would be the good of a look out if the man couldn t tell where the fire be. but it s all pitchy black and the light be so confuse. 
you ll be more confuse in ten minute. you ll have lose your way a you never lose it before. you re go to go round bow bazar section. 
and the lord have mercy on my soul. calcutta the dark portion of it doe not look an invite place to dive into at night. 
chapter vi. 
the city of dreadful night. 
and since they cannot spend or use aright the little time here give them in trust but lavish it in weary undelight of foolish toil and trouble strife and lust they naturally clamour to inherit the everlasting future that their merit may have full scope. a surely be most just. 
the city of dreadful night. 
the difficulty be to prevent this account from grow steadily unwholesome. but one cannot rake through a big city without encounter muck. 
the police keep their word. in five short minute a they have prophesy their charge be lose a he have never be lose before. where be we now. somewhere off the chitpore road but you wouldn t understand if you be tell. follow now and step pretty much where we step there s a good deal of filth hereabouts. 
the thick greasy night shut in everything. we have go beyond the ancestral house of the ghoses of the bos beyond the lamp the smell and the crowd of chitpore road and have come to a great wilderness of pack house just such mysterious conspire tenement a dickens would have love. there be no breeze here and the air be perceptibly warm. if calcutta keep such luxury a commissioner of sewer and pave they die before they reach this place. the air be heavy with a faint sour stench the essence of long neglect abomination and it cannot escape from among the tall three storied house. this my dear sir be a perfectly respectable quarter a quarter go. that house at the head of the alley with the elaborate stucco work round the top of the door be build long ago by a celebrate midwife. great people use to live here once. now it s the aha. look out for that carriage. a big mail phaeton crash out of the darkness and recklessly drive disappear. the wonder be how it ever get into this maze of narrow street where nobody seem to be move and where the dull throb of the city s life only come faintly and by snatch. now it s the what. the st. john s wood of calcutta for the rich babu. that fitton belong to one of them. well it s not much of a place to look at. don t judge by appearance. about here live the woman who have beggar king. we aren t go to let you down into unadulterated vice all at once. you must see it first with the gild on and mind that rotten board. 
stand at the bottom of a lift shaft and look upwards. then you will get both the size and the design of the tiny courtyard round which one of these big dark house be build. the central square may be perhaps ten foot every way but the balcony that run inside it overhang and seem to cut away half the available space. to reach the square a man must go round many corner down a cover in way and up and down two or three baffle and confuse step. now you will understand say the police kindly a their charge blunder shin first into a well dark wind staircase that these be not the sort of place to visit alone. who want to. of all the disgust inaccessible den holy cupid what s this. 
a glare of light on the stair head a clink of innumerable bangle a rustle of much fine gauze and the dainty iniquity stand reveal blaze literally blaze with jewellery from head to foot. take one of the fair miniature that the delhi painter draw and multiply it by ten. throw in one of angelica kaufmann s best portrait and add anything that you can think of from beckford to lalla rookh and you will still fall short of the merit of that perfect face. for an instant even the grim professional gravity of the police be relax in the presence of the dainty iniquity with the gem who so prettily invite every one to be seat and proffer such refreshment a she conceive the palate of the barbarian would prefer. her maid be only one degree le gorgeous than she. half a lakh or fifty thousand pound worth it be easy to credit the latter statement than the former be dispose upon her little body. each hand carry five jewel ring which be connect by golden chain to a great jewel bos of gold in the centre of the back of the hand. ear ring weight with emerald and pearl diamond nose ring and how many other hundred article make up the list of adornment. english furniture of a gorgeous and gimcrack kind unlimited chandelier and a collection of atrocious continental print be scatter about the house and on every land squat or loaf a bengali who can talk english with unholy fluency. the recurrence suggest only suggest mind a grim possibility of the affectation of excessive virtue by day temper with the sort of unwholesome enjoyment after dusk this loaf and lobby and chatter and smoke and unless the bottle lie tipple among the foul tongue handmaiden of the dainty iniquity. how many men follow this double deleterious sort of life. the police be discreetly dumb. 
now don t go talk about domiciliary visit just because this one happen to be a pretty woman. we ve get to know these creature. they make the rich man and the poor spend their money. and when a man can t get money for em honestly he come under our notice. now do you see. if there be any domiciliary visit about it the whole houseful would be hide past our find a soon a we turn up in the courtyard. we re friend to a certain extent. and indeed it seem no difficult thing to be friend to any extent with the dainty iniquity who be so surpassingly different from all that experience teach of the beauty of the east. here be the face from which a man could write lalla rookhs by the dozen and believe every work that he write. hers be the beauty that byron sing of when he write. 
remember if you come here alone the chance be that you ll be club or stick or anyhow mob. you ll understand that this part of the world be shut to european absolutely. mind the step and follow on. the vision dy out in the smell and gross darkness of the night in evil time rotten brickwork and another wilderness of shut up house. 
follow after another plunge into a passage of a courtyard and up a staircase the apparition of a fat vice in whom be no sort of romance nor beauty but unlimited coarse humour. she too be stud with jewel and her house be even fine than the house of the other and more infest with the extraordinary men who speak such good english and be so deferential to the police. the fat vice ha be a great leader of fashion in her day and strip a zemindar raja to his last acre insomuch that he end in the house of correction for a theft commit for her sake. native opinion ha it that she be a monstrous well preserve woman. on this point a on some others the race will agree to differ. 
the scene change suddenly a a slide in a magic lantern. dainty iniquity and fat vice slide away on a roll of street and alley each more squalid than it predecessor. we be somewhere at the back of the machua bazar well in the heart of the city. there be no house here nothing but acre and acre it seem of foul wattle and dab hut any one of which would be a disgrace to a frontier village. the whole arrangement be a neatly contrive germ and fire trap reflect great credit upon the calcutta municipality. 
what happen when these pigsty catch fire. they re build up again say the police a though this be the natural order of thing. land be immensely valuable here. all the more reason then to turn several hausmanns loose into the city with instruction to make barrack for the population that cannot find room in the hut and sleep in the open way cherish dog and bad much bad in it unwashen bosom. here be a license coffee shop. this be where your servant go for amusement and to see nautch. there be a huge thatch shed ingeniously ornament with insecure kerosene lamp and cram with driver cook small store keeper and the like. never a sign of a european. why. because if an englishman mess about here he d get into trouble. men don t come here unless they re drink or have lose their way. the hack driver they have the privilege of vote have they not. look peaceful enough a they squat on table or crowd by the door to watch the nautch that be go forward. five pitiful draggle tail be huddle together on a bench under one of the lamp while the sixth be squirm and shriek before the impassive crowd. she sing of love a understand by the oriental the love that dry the heart and consume the liver. in this place the word that would look so well on paper have an evil and ghastly significance. the men stare or sup tumbler and cup of a filthy decoction and the kunchenee howl with renew vigour in the presence of the police. where the dainty iniquity be hang with gold and gem she be trap with pewter and glass. and where there be heavy embroidery on the fat vice s dress deface stamp tinsel faithfully reduplicate the pattern on the tawdry robe of the kunchenee. 
two or three men with uneasy conscience have quietly slip out of the coffee shop into the maze of the hut. the police laugh and those near in the crowd laugh applausively a in duty bind. perhaps the rabbit grin uneasily when the ferret land at the bottom of the burrow and begin to clear the warren. 
the chandoo shop shut up at six so you ll have to see opium smoke before dark some day. no you win t though. the detective make for a half open door of a hut whence float the fragrance of the black smoke. those of the inhabitant who be able promptly clear out they have no love for the police and there remain only four men lie down and one stand up. this latter ha a pet mongoose coil round his neck. he speak english fluently. yes he ha no fear. it be a private smoke party and no business to night show how you smoke opium. aha. you want to see. very good i show. hiya. you he kick a man on the floor show how opium smoke. the kickee grunt lazily and turn on his elbow. the mongoose always keep to the man s neck erect every hair of it body like an angry cat and chatter in it owner s ear. the lamp for the opium pipe be the only one in the room and light a scene a wild a anything in the witch revel. the mongoose act a the familiar spirit. a voice from the grind say in tone of infinite weariness. you take afim_ so a long long pause and another kick from the man possess of the devil the mongoose. you take afim. he take a pellet of the black treacly stuff on the end of a knit needle. and light afim. he plunge the pellet into the night light where it swell and fume greasily. and then you put it in your pipe. the smoke pellet be jam into the tiny bowl of the thick bamboo stem pipe and all speech cease except the unearthly chitter of the mongoose. the man on the grind be suck at his pipe and when the smoke pellet ha cease to smoke will be half way to nibban. now you go say the man with the mongoose. i be go smoke. the hut floor close upon a red light view of huddle leg and body and the man with the mongoose sink sink on to his knee his head bow forward and the little hairy devil chatter on the nape of his neck. 
after this the fetid night air seem almost cool for the hut be a hot a a furnace. now for colootollah. come through the hut. there be no decoration about this vice. 
the hut now give place to house very tall and spacious and very dark. but for the narrowness of the street we might have stumble upon chowringhi in the dark. an hour and a half ha pass and up to this time we have not cross our trail once. you might knock about the city for a night and never cross the same line. recollect calcutta isn t one of your poky up country city of a lakh and a half of people. how long doe it take to know it then. about a lifetime and even then some of the street puzzle you. how much ha the head of a ward to know. every house in his ward if he can who own it what sort of character the inhabitant be who be their friend who go out and in who loaf about the place at night and so on and so on. and he know all this by night a well a by day. of course. why shouldn t he. no reason in the world. only it s pitchy black just now and i d like to see where this alley be go to end. round the corner beyond that dead wall. there s a lamp there. then you ll be able to see. a shadow flit out of a gulley and disappear. who s that. sergeant of police just to see where we re go in case of accident. another shadow stagger into the darkness. who s that. soldier from the fort or a sailor from the ship. i couldn t quite see. the police open a shut door in a high wall and stumble unceremoniously among a gang of woman cook their food. the floor be of beat earth the step that lead into the upper story be unspeakably grimy and the heat be the heat of april. the woman rise hastily and the light of the bull s eye for the police have now light a lantern in regular london fashion show six blear face one a half native half chinese one and the others bengali. there be no men here. they cry. the house be empty. then they grin and jabber and chew pan and spit and hurry up the step into the darkness. a range of three big room ha be knock into one here and there be some sort of arrangement of mat. but an average country breed be more sumptuously accommodate in an englishman s stable. a horse would snort at the accommodation. 
nice sort of place isn t it. say the police genially. this be where the sailor get rob and drink. they must be blind drink before they come. na na. na sailor men ee yah. chorus the woman catch at the one word they understand. arl go. the police take no notice but tramp down the big room with the mat loose box. a woman be shiver in one of these. what s the matter. fever. seek. vary vary seek. she huddle herself into a heap on the charpoy and groan. 
a tiny pitch black closet open out of the long room and into this the police plunge. hullo. what s here. down flash the lantern and a white hand with black nail come out of the gloom. somebody be asleep or drink in the cot. the ring of lantern light travel slowly up and down the body. a sailor from the ship. he ll be rob before the morning most likely. the man be sleep like a little child both arm throw over his head and he be not unhandsome. he be shoeless and there be huge hole in his stocking. he be a pure blood white and carry the flush of innocent sleep on his cheek. 
the light be turn off and the police depart. while the woman in the loose box shiver and moan that she be seek. vary vary seek. 
chapter vii. 
deep and deep still. 
i build myself a lordly pleasure house wherein at ease for aye to dwell. i say. o soul make merry and carouse. dear soul for all be well. 
the palace of art. 
and where next. i don t like colootollah. the police and their charge be stand in the interminable waste of house under the starlight. to the low sink of all but you wouldn t know if you be tell. they lead till they come to the last circle of the inferno a long quiet wind road. there you be. you can see for yourself. 
but there be nothing to be see. on one side be house gaunt and dark naked and devoid of furniture. on the other low mean stall light and with shamelessly open door where woman stand and mutter and whisper one to another. there be a hush here or at least the busy silence of an officer of count house in work hour. one look down the street be sufficient. lead on gentleman of the calcutta police. we do not love the line of open door the flare lamp within the glimpse of the tawdry toilet table adorn with little plaster dog glass ball from christmas tree and for religion must not be despise though woman be fall picture of the saint and statuette of the virgin. the street be a long one and other street full of the same pitiful ware branch off from it. 
why be they so quiet. why don t they make a row and sing and shout and so on. why should they poor devil. say the police and fall to tell tale of horror of woman decoy and shoot into this trap. then other tale that shatter one s belief in all thing and folk of good repute. how can you police have faith in humanity. 
that s because you re see it all in a lump for the first time and it s not nice that way. make a man jump rather doesn t it. but recollect you ve ask for the bad place and you can t complain. who s complain. bring on your atrocity. isn t that a european woman at that door. yes. mr. d widow of a soldier mother of seven child. nine if you please and good even to you shrill mr. d lean against the door post her arm fold on her bosom. she be a rather pretty slightly make eurasian and whatever shame she may have own she ha long since cast behind her. a shapeless burmo native trot with high cheek bone and mouth like a shark call mr. d mem sahib. the word jar unspeakably. her life be a matter between herself and her maker but in that she the widow of a soldier of the queen ha stoop to this common foulness in the face of the city she ha offend against the white race. you re from up country and of course you don t understand. there be any amount of that lot in the city say the police. then the secret of the insolence of calcutta be make plain. small wonder the native fail to respect the sahib see what they see and know what they know. in the good old day the honourable the director deport him or her who misbehave grossly and the white man preserve his face. he may have be a ruffian but he be a ruffian on a large scale. he do not sink in the presence of the people. the native be quite right to take the wall of the sahib who ha be at great pain to prove that he be of the same flesh and blood. 
all this time mr. d stand on the threshold of her room and look upon the men with unabashed eye. mr. d be a lady with a story. she be not averse to tell it. what be ahem the case in which you be er hmn concern mr. d. they say i d poison my husband by put something into his drink water. this be interest. and ah do you. twasn t prove say mr. d with a laugh a pleasant lady like laugh that doe infinite credit to her education and upbringing. worthy mr. d. it would pay a novelist a french one let u say to pick you out of the stew and make you talk. 
the police move forward into a region of mr. d s. everywhere be the empty house and the babble woman in print gown. the clock in the city be close upon midnight but the police show no sign of stop. they plunge hither and thither like wrecker into the surf. and each plunge bring up a sample of misery filth and woe. 
a woman eurasian rise to a sit position on a cot and blink sleepily at the police. then she throw herself down with a grunt. what s the matter with you. i live in markiss lane and this with intense gravity i m so drink. she ha a rather strike gipsy like face but her language might be improve. 
come along say the police we ll head back to bentinck street and put you on the road to the great eastern. they walk long and steadily and the talk fall on gamble hell. you ought to see our men rush one of em. when we ve mark a hell down we post men at the entrance and carry it. sometimes the chinese bite but a a rule they fight fair. it s a pity we hadn t a hell to show you. let s go in here there may be something forward. here appear to be in the heart of a chinese quarter for the pigtail do they ever go to bed. be scuttle about the street. never go into a chinese place alone say the police and swing open a postern gate in a strong green door. two chinaman appear. 
what be we go to see. japanese gir no we aren t by jove. catch that chinaman quick. the pigtail be try to double back across a courtyard into an inner chamber. but a large hand on his shoulder spin him round and put him in rear of the line of advance englishman who be be it observe make a fair amount of noise with their boot. a second door be throw open and the visitor advance into a large square room blaze with gas. here thirteen pigtail deaf and blind to the out world be bend over a table. the capture chinaman dodge uneasily in the rear of the procession. five ten fifteen second pas the englishman stand in the full light le than three pace from the absorb gang who see nothing. then the burly superintendent bring his hand down on his thigh with a crack like a pistol shoot and shout. how do john. follow a frantic rush of scar celestials almost tumble over each other in their anxiety to get clear. one pigtail scoop up a pile of copper money another a chinaware soup bowl and only a little mound of accuse cowry remain on the white mat that cover the table. in le than half a minute two fact be forcibly bring home to the visitor. first that a pigtail be largely compose of silk and rasp the palm of the hand a it slide through. and secondly that the forearm of a chinaman be surprisingly muscular and well develop. what s go to be do. nothing. there be only three of u and all the ringleader would get away. we ve get em safe any time we want to catch em if this little visit doesn t make em shift their quarter. hi. john. no pidgin to night. show how you makee play. that fat youngster there be our informer. 
half the pigtail have flee into the darkness but the remainder assure and trebly assure that the police really mean no pidgin return to the table and stand round while the croupier manipulate the cowry the little curve slip of bamboo and the soup bowl. they never gamble these innocent. they only come to look on and smoke opium in the next room. yet a the game progress their eye light up and one by one put their money on odd or even the number of the cowry that be cover and leave uncover by the little soup bowl. mythan be the name of the amusement and whatever may be it demerit it be clean. the police look on while their charge play and loot a parchment skin horror one of swift s struldburgs stray from laputa of the enormous sum of two anna. the return of this wealth double set the loser beat his forehead against the table from sheer gratitude. 
most immoral game this. a man might drop five whole rupee if he begin play at sun down and keep it up all night. don t you ever play whist occasionally. 
now we didn t bring you round to make fun of this department. a man can lose a much a ever he like and he can fight a well and if he lose all his money he steal to get more. a chinaman be insane about gamble and half his crime come from it. it must be keep down. here we be in bentinck street and you can be drive to the great eastern in a few minute. joss house. oh yes. if you want more horror superintendent lamb will take you round with him to morrow afternoon at five. good night. 
the police depart and in a few minute the silent respectability of old council house street with the grim free kirk at the end of it be reach. all good calcutta ha go to bed the last tram ha pass and the peace of the night be upon the world. would it be wise and rational to climb the spire of that kirk and shout. o true believer. decency be a fraud and a sham. there be nothing clean or pure or wholesome under the star and we be all go to perdition together. amen. on second thought it would not. for the spire be slippery the night be hot and the police have be specially careful to warn their charge that he must not be carry away by the sight of horror that cannot be write or hint at. 
good morning say the policeman tramp the pavement in front of the great eastern and he nod his head pleasantly to show that he be the representative of law and peace and that the city of calcutta be safe from itself for the present. 
chapter viii. 
concern lucia. 
time must be fill in somehow till five this afternoon when superintendent lamb will reveal more horror. why not the tram aid go to the old park street cemetery. 
you want go park street. no tram go park street. you get out here. calcutta tram conductor be not polite. the car shuffle unsympathetically down the street and the evict be strand in dhurrumtollah which may be the hammersmith highway of calcutta. providence arrange this mistake and pave the way to a great discovery now publish for the first time. dhurrumtollah be full of the people of india walk in family party and group and confidential couple. and the people of india be neither hindu nor mussulman jew ethiop gueber or expatriate british. they be the eurasian and there be hundred and hundred of them in dhurrumtollah now. there be papa with a shin black hat fit for a counsellor of the queen and mamma whose silken dress be tight upon her portly figure and the brood make up of straw hat olive cheek sharp eye little boy and leggy maiden wear white open work stocking calculate to show dust. there be the young men who smoke bad cigar and carry themselves lordily such a have income. there be also the young woman with the beautiful eye and the wonderful dress which always fit so badly across the shoulder. and they carry prayer book or basket because they be either go to mass or the market. without doubt these be the people of india. they be bear in it breed in it and will die in it. the englishman only come to the country and the native of course be there from the first but these people have be make here and no one ha do anything for them except talk and write about them. yet they belong some of them to old and honourable family hold house in sealdah and be rich a few of them. they all look prosperous and content and they chatter eternally in that curious dialect that no one ha yet reduce to print. beyond what little they please to reveal now and again in the newspaper we know nothing about their life which touch so intimately the white on the one hand and the black on the other. it must be interest more interest than the colourless anglo indian article. but who ha treat of it. there be one novel once in which the second heroine be an eurasienne. she be a strictly subordinate character and come to a sad end. the poet of the race henry derozio he of whom mr. thomas edward write a history be bite with keats and scott and shelley and overlook in his search for material thing that lay near to him. all this mass of humanity in dhurrumtollah be unexploited and almost unknown. want therefore a writer from among the eurasian who shall write so that men shall be please to read a story of eurasian life. then outsider will be interest in the people of india and will admit that the race ha possibility. 
a futile attempt to get to park street from dhurrumtollah end in the market the hogg market men call it. perhaps a knight of that name build it. it be not one half a pretty a the crawford market in bombay but. it appear to be the trysting place of young calcutta. the natural inclination of youth be to lie abed late and to let the senior do all the hard work. why therefore should pyramus who ha to be rule account form at ten and thisbe who cannot be interest in the price of second quality beef wander in studiously correct raiment round and about the stall before the sun be well clear of the earth. pyramus carry a walk stick with imitation silver strap upon it and there be cloth top to his boot. but his collar ha be two day wear. thisbe crown her dark head with a blue velvet tam o shanter. but one of her boot lack a button and there be a tear in the leave hand glove. mamma who despise glove be rapidly fill a shallow basket that the coolie boy carry with vegetable potato purple brinjal and oh pyramus. do you ever kiss thisbe when mamma be not by. garlic yea lusson of the bazaar. mamma be generous in her view on garlic. pyramus come round the corner of the stall look for nobody in particular not he and be elaborately polite to mamma. somehow he and thisbe drift off together and mamma very portly and very voluble be leave to chaffer and sort and select alone. in the name of the sacred unity do not young people retire to the meat stall to exchange confidence. come up to this end where the rose be arrive in great flat basket where the air be heavy with the fragrance of flower and the young bud and greenery be litter all the floor. they win t they prefer talk by the dead unromantic mutton where there be not so many buyer. there must have be a quarrel to make up. thisbe shake the blue velvet tam o shanter and say oah yes. scornfully. pyramus answer. no a no a. do ant say thatt. mamma s basket be full and she pick up thisbe hastily. pyramus depart. he never come here to do any market. he come to meet thisbe who in ten year will own a figure very much like mamma s. may their way be smooth before them and after honest service of the government may pyramus retire on rupee per mensem into a nice little house somewhere in monghyr or chunar. 
from love by natural sequence to death. where be the park street cemetery. a hundred hack driver leap from their box and invade the market and after a short struggle one of them uncarts his capture in a burial grind a ghastly new place close to a tramway. this be not what be want. the live dead be here the people whose name be not yet altogether perish and whose tombstone be tend. where be the old dead. nobody go there say the driver. it be up that road. he point up a long and utterly desert thoroughfare run between high wall. this be the place and the entrance to it with it gardener wait with one brown batter rise for the visitor it grill door and it professional notice bear a hideous liken to the entrance of simla churchyard. but once inside the sightseer stand in the heart of utter desolation all the more forlorn for be sweep up. low park street cut a great graveyard in two. the guide book will tell you when the place be open and when it be close. the eye be ready to swear that it be a old a herculaneum and pompeii. the tomb be small house. it be a though we walk down the street of a town so tall be they and so closely do they stand a town shrivel by fire and scar by frost and siege. men must have be afraid of their friend rise up before the due time that they weight them with such cruel mound of masonry. strong man weak woman or somebody s infant son age fifteen month for each the squat obelisk the deface classic temple the cellaret of chunam or the candlestick of brickwork the heavy slab the rust eat railing the whopper jaw cherub and the apoplectic angel. men be rich in those day and could afford to put a hundred cubic foot of masonry into the grave of even so humble a person a jno. clements captain of the country service. when the dearly beloved have hold rank answer to that of commissioner the effort be still more sumptuous and the verse. well the follow speak for itself. 
soft on thy tomb shall fond remembrance shed the warm yet unavailing tear and purple flower that deck the honour dead shall strew the love and honour bier. 
failure to comply with the contract doe not let u hope entail forfeiture of the earnest money. or the honour dead might be grieve. the slab be out of his tomb and lean foolishly against it. the railing be rot and there be no more last ornament than blister and stain which be the work of the weather and not the result of the warm yet unavailing tear. 
let u go about and moralise cheaply on the tombstone trail the robe of pious reflection up and down the pathway of the grave. here be a big and stately tomb sacred to lucia who die in a. d. age. here also be lichened verse which an irreverent thumb can bring to light. thus they write when their heart be heavy in them one hundred and sixteen year ago. 
what need the emblem what the plaintive strain what all the art that sculpture e er express to tell the treasure that these wall contain. let those declare it most who know her best. 
the tender pity she would oft display shall be with interest at her shrine return connubial love connubial tear repay and lucia love shall still be lucia mourn. 
though close the lip though stop the tuneful breath the silent clay cold monitress shall teach in all the alarm eloquence of death with double pathos to the heart shall preach. 
shall teach the virtuous maid the faithful wife if young and fair that young and fair be she then close the useful lesson of her life and tell them what she be they soon must be. 
that go well even after all these year doe it not. and seem to bring lucia very near in spite of what the late generation be please to call the stiltedness of the old time verse. 
who will declare the merit of lucia dead in her spring before there be even a hickey s gazette to chronicle the amusement of calcutta and publish with scurrilous asterisk the liaison of head of department. what pot belly east indiaman bring the virtuous maid up the river and do lucia make her bargain a the cant of those time go on the first second or third day after her arrival. or do she with the others of the batch give a spinster ball a a last trial follow the custom of the country. no. she be a fair kentish maiden send out at a cost of five hundred pound english money under the captain s charge to wed the man of her choice and he know clive well have have dealing with omichand and talk to men who have live through the terrible night in the black hole. he be a rich man lucia s batter tomb prof it and he give lucia all that her heart could wish. a green paint boat to take the air in on the river of evening. coffree slave boy who could play on the french horn and even a very elegant neat coach with a genteel rutlan roof ornament with flower very highly finish ten best polish plate glass ornament with a few elegant medallion enrich with mother o pearl that she might take her drive on the course a befit a factor s wife. all these thing he give her. and when the convoy come up the river and the gun thunder and the servant of the honourable the east india company drink to the king s health be sure that lucia before all the other lady in the fort have her choice of the new stuff from england and be cordially hat in consequence. tilly kettle paint her picture a little before she die and the hot blood young writer do duel with small sword in the fort ditch for the honour of pilot her through a minuet at the calcutta theatre or the punch house. but warren hastings dance with her instead and the writer be confound every man of them. she be a toast far up the river. and she walk in the even on the bastion of fort william and say la. i protest. it be there that she exchange congratulation with all her friend on the th of october when those who be alive gather together to felicitate themselves on have come through another hot season. and the men even the sober factor saw no wrong here get most royally and britishly drink on madeira that have twice round the cape. but lucia fell sick and the doctor he who go home after seven year with five lakh and a half and a corner of this vast graveyard to his account say that it be a pukka or putrid fever and the system require strengthen. so they feed lucia on hot curry and mull wine work up with spirit and fortify with spice for nearly a week. at the end of which time she close her eye on the weary river and the fort for ever and a gallant with a turn for belle lettres_ weep openly a men do then and have no shame of it and compose the verse above set and think himself a neat hand at the pen stap his vitals. but the factor be so grieve that he could write nothing at all could only spend his money and he count his wealth by lakh on a sumptuous grave. a little late on he take comfort and when the next batch come out. 
but this ha nothing whatever to do with the story of lucia the virtuous maid the faithful wife. her ghost go to a big calcutta powder ball that very night and look very beautiful. i meet her. 
among the railway folk. 
chapter i. 
mar. 
a railway settlement. 
jamalpur be the headquarter of the east india railway. this in itself be not a startle statement. the wonder begin with the exploration of jamalpur which be a station entirely make by and devote to the use of those untiring servant of the public the railway folk. they have town of their own at toondla and assensole. a sun dry sanitarium at bandikui. and howrah ajmir allahabad lahore and pindi know their colony. but jamalpur be unadulteratedly railway and he who ha nothing to do with the e. i. railway in some shape or another feel a strange and an interloper. run always east and southerly the train carry him from the torment of the northwest into the wet woolly warmth of bengal where may be find the hothouse heat that ha ruin the temper of the good people of calcutta. the land be fat and greasy with good live and the wealth of the body of innumerable dead thing. and here just above mokameh may be see field stretch without stick stone or bush to break the view from the railway line to the horizon. 
up country innocent must look at the map to learn that jamalpur be near the top leave hand corner of the big loop that the e. i. r. throw out round bhagalpur and part of the bara banki district. northward of jamalpur a near a may be lie the gang and tirhoot and eastward an offshoot of the volcanic rajmehal range block the view. 
a station which ha neither judge commissioner deputy or stunt which be devoid of law court ticca gharies_ district superintendent of police and many other evidence of an over culture civilisation be a curiosity. we administer ourselves say jamalpur proudly or we do till we have local self government in and now the racket marker administer u. this be a solemn fact. the station which have it beginning thirty odd year ago use till comparatively recent time to control it own road sewage conservancy and the like. but with the introduction of local self government it be ordain that the inestimable boon should be extend to a place make by and maintain for european and a brand new municipality be create and nominate accord to the many rule of the game. in the skirmish that ensue the club racket marker fight his way to the front secure a place on a board largely compose of babu and since that day jamalpur s view on government have not be fit for publication. to understand the magnitude of the insult one must study the city for station in the strict sense of the word it be not. croton palm mango mellingtonias_ teak and bamboo adorn it and the poinsettia and bougainvillea_ the railway creeper and the bignonia venusta_ make it gay with many colour. it be lay out with military precision to each house it just share of garden it red brick path it growth of tree and it neat little wicket gate. it general aspect in spite of the dutch formality be that of an english village such a thing a enterprising stage manager put on the theatre at home. the hill have throw a protect arm round nearly three side of it and on the fourth it be bound by what be locally know a the shed. in other word the station office and workshop of the company. the e. i. r. only exist for outsider. it servant speak of it reverently angrily despitefully or enthusiastically a the company. and they never omit the big big c. men must have treat the honourable the east india company in something the same fashion age ago. the company in jamalpur be lord dufferin all the member of council the body guard sir frederick robert mr. westland whose name be at the bottom of the currency note the oriental life assurance company and the bengal government all roll into one. at first when a strange enter this life he be incline to scoff and ask in his ignorance _what be this company that you talk so much about. late on he cease to scoff. for the company be a big thing almost big enough to satisfy an american. 
ere begin to describe it do let it be write and repeat several time hereafter that the e. i. r. passenger carriage and especially the second class be just now horrid be filthy and unwashen dirty to look at and dirty to live in. have cast this small stone we will examine jamalpur. when it be lay out in or before the mutiny year it designer allow room for growth and make the house of one general design some of brick some of stone some three four and six room some single men s barrack and some two storied all for the use of the employ√©s. king s road prince s road queen s road and victoria road jamalpur be loyal cut the breadth of the station. and albert road church street and steam road the length of it. neither on these road or on any of the cool shade small one be anything unclean or unsightly to be find. there be a dreary village in the neighbourhood which be say to make the most of any cholera that may be go but jamalpur itself be specklessly and spotlessly neat. from st. mary s church to the railway station and from the building where they print daily about half a lakh of ticket to the ring roar rattle workshop everything ha the air of have be clean up at ten that very morning and put under a glass case. there be a holy calm about the road totally unlike anything in an english manufacture town. wheel conveyance be few because every man s bungalow be close to his work and when the day ha begin and the office of the loco. and traffic have soak up their thousand of native and hundred of european you shall pas under the dapple shadow of the tree hear nothing loud than the croon of some bearer play with a child in the verandah or the faint tinkle of a piano. this be pleasant and produce an impression of watteau like refinement temper with arcadian simplicity. the dry anguish howl of the buzzer the big steam whistle break the hush and all jamalpur be alive with the tramp of tiffin seek foot. the company give one hour for meal between eleven and twelve. on the stroke of noon there be another rush back to the work or the office and jamalpur sleep through the afternoon till four or half past and then rous for tennis at the institute. 
in the hot weather it splash in the swim bath or read for it ha a library of several thousand book. one of the most nourish lodge in the bengal jurisdiction st. george in the east life at jamalpur and meet twice a month. it member point out with justifiable pride that all the fitting be make by their own hand. and the lodge in it accoutrement and the energy of the craftsman can compare with any in india. but the institute be the central gather place and it half dozen tennis court and neatly lay out ground seem to be always full. here if a strange could judge the great part of the flirtation of jamalpur be carry out and here the dash apprentice the apprentice be the lively of all learn that there be problem hard than any he study at the night school and that the heart of a maiden be more inscrutable than the mechanism of a locomotive. on tuesday and friday the volunteer parade. a and b company strong in all of the e. i. r. volunteer be station here with the band. their uniform grey with red facing be not lovely but they know how to shoot and drill. they have to. the company make it a condition of service that a man must be a volunteer. and volunteer in something more than name he must be or some one will ask the reason why. see that there be no regular between howrah and dinapore the company doe well in exact this toll. some of the old soldier be weary of drill some of the youngster don t like it but the way they entrain and detrain be worth see. they be a mobile a corp a can be desire and perhaps ten or twelve year hence the government may possibly be lead to take a real interest in them and spend a few thousand rupee in provide them with real soldier kit not uniform and rifle merely. their rank include all sort and condition of men head of the loco. and traffic the company be no respecter of rank clerk in the audit boy from mercantile firm at home fight with the intricacy of time fare and freight table. guard who have grow grey in the service of the company. mail and passenger driver with nerve of cast iron who can shoot through a long afternoon without lose temper or flurry. light blue east indian. tyne side men slow of speech and uncommonly strong in the arm. lathy apprentice who have not yet fill out. fitter turner foreman full assistant and sub assistant station master and a host of others. in the hand of the young men the regulation martini henri naturally go off the line occasionally on hunt expedition. 
there be a twelve hundred yard range run down one side of the station and the condition of the grass by the fire butt tell it own tale. scatter in the rank of the volunteer be a fair number of old soldier for the company ha a weakness for recruit from the army for it guard who may in time become station master. a good man from the army with his paper all correct and certificate from his command officer can after deposit twenty pound to pay his home passage in the event of his service be dispense with enter the company s service on something le than one hundred rupee a month and rise in time to four hundred a a station master. a railway bungalow and they be a substantially build a the engine will cost him more than one ninth of the pay of his grade and the provident fund provide for his latter end. 
think for a moment of the number of men that a line run from howrah to delhi must use and you will realise what an enormous amount of patronage the company hold in it hand. naturally a father who ha work for the line expect the line to do something for the son. and the line be not backward in meet his wish where possible. the son of old servant may be take on at fifteen year of age or thereabouts a apprentice in the shop receive twenty rupee in the first and fifty in the last year of their indenture. then they come on the book a full men on perhaps r. a month and the road be open to them in many way. they may become foreman of department on r. a month or driver earn with overtime r. or if they have be bring into the audit or the traffic they may control innumerable babu and draw several hundred of rupee monthly. or at eighteen or nineteen they may be ticket collector work up to the grade of guard etc. every rank of the huge human hive ha a desire to see it son place properly and the native workman about three thousand in the locomotive department only be say one man make a family affair of it altogether. you see all those men turn brass and look after the machinery. they ve all get relative and a lot of em own land out monghyr way close to u. they bring on their son a soon a they be old enough to do anything and the company rather encourage it. you see the father be in a way responsible for his son and he ll teach him all he know and in that way the company ha a hold on them all. you ve no notion how sharp a native be when he s work on his own hook. all the district round here right up to monghyr be more or le dependent on the railway. 
the babu in the traffic department in the store issue department in all the department where men sit through the long long indian day among ledger and check and pencil and deal in figure and item and rupee may be count by hundred. imagine the struggle among them to locate their son in comfortable cane bottom chair in front of a big pewter inkstand and stack of paper. the babu make beautiful accountant and if we could only see it a merciful providence ha make the babu for figure and detail. without him the dividend of any company would be eat up by the expense of english or city breed clerk. the babu be a great man and to respect him you must see five score or so of him in a room a hundred yard long bend over ledger ledger and yet more ledger silent a the sphinx and busy a a bee. he be the lubricant of the great machinery of the company whose way and work cannot be deal with in a single scrawl. 
chapter ii. 
the shop. 
the railway folk like the army and civilian caste have their own language and life which an outsider cannot hope to understand. for instance when jamalpur refer to itself a be on the long side a lengthy explanation be necessary before the visitor grasp the fact that the whole of the two hundred and thirty odd mile of the loop from luckeeserai to kanu junction via bhagalpur be thus contemptuously treat. jamalpur insist that it be out of the world and make this an excuse for be proud of itself and all it institution. but in one thing it be badly disgracefully provide. at a moderate estimate there must be about two hundred european with their family in this place. they can and do get their small supply from calcutta but they be dependent on the tender mercy of the bazaar for their meat which seem to be hawk from door to door. there be a raja who own or ha an interest in the land on which the station stand and he be averse to cow kill. for these reason jamalpur be not too well supply with good meat and what it want be a decent meat market with cleanly control slaughter arrangement. the company who give grant to the school and build the institute and throw the shadow of it protection all over the place might help this scheme forward. 
the heart of jamalpur be the shop and here a visitor will see more thing in an hour than he can understand in a year. steam street very appropriately lead to the forty or fifty acre that the shop cover and to the busy silence of the loco. superintendent s office where a man must put down his name and his business on a slip of paper before he can penetrate into the temple of vulcan. about three thousand five hundred men be in the shop and ten minute after the day s work ha begin the assistant superintendent know exactly how many be in. the head of department silent heavy hand men captain of five hundred or more have their name fairly print on a board which be exactly like a pool marker. they star a life when they come in and their few name alone represent salary to the extent of six thousand a month. they be men worth hear deferentially. they hail from manchester and the clyde and the great ironwork of the north. pleasant a cold water in a thirsty land be it to hear again the full northumbrian burr or the long draw yorkshire aye. under their great gravity of demeanour a man who be in charge of a few lakh worth of plant cannot afford to be riotously mirthful lurk melody and humour. they can sing like north countryman and in their hour of ease go back to the speech of the iron country they have leave behind when ab o th yate and all ben briarly s shrewd wit shake the warm air of bengal with deep chested laughter. hear ruglan toon with a chorus a true a the fall of trip hammer and fancy that you be back again in the smoky rattle ring north. 
but this be the unofficial side. go forward through the gate under the mango tree and set foot at once in shed which have a little to do with mango a a locomotive with lakshmi. the buzzer howl for it be nearly tiffin time. there be a rush from every quarter of the shop a cloud of fly native and a procession of more sedately pace englishman and in three short minute you be leave absolutely alone among arrest wheel and belt pulley crank and crane in a silence only break by the soft sigh of a far away steam valve or the coo of pigeon. you be by favour freely grant at liberty to wander anywhere you please through the desert work. walk into a huge brick build tin roof stable capable of hold twenty four locomotive under treatment and see what must be do to the iron horse once in every three year if he be to do his work well. on reflection iron horse be wrong. an engine be a she a distinctly feminine a a ship or a mine. here stand the echo_ her wheel off rest on block her underside machinery take out and her side scrawl with mysterious hieroglyphic in chalk. an enormous green paint iron harness rack bear her piston and eccentric rod and a neatly paint board show that such and such englishman be the fit assistant and apprentice engage in edit that echo. an engine see from the platform and an engine view from underneath be two very different thing. the one be a unimpressive a a cart. the other a impose a a man of war in the yard. 
in this manner be an engine treat for navicular laminitis back sinew or whatever it be that engine most suffer from. no. we will say go wrong at dinapore assensole buxar or wherever it may be after three year work. the place she come from be stencil on the boiler and the foreman examine her. then he fill in a hospital sheet which bear one hundred and eighty print head under which an engine can come into the shop. no. need repair in only one hundred and eighteen particular range from mud hole flange and blower cock to lead plug and platform bracket which have shake loose. this certificate the foreman sign and it be frame near the engine for the benefit of the three european and the eight or nine native who have to mend no. to the ignorant the superhuman wisdom of the examiner seem only equal by the audacity of the two men and the boy who be to undertake what be frivolously call the job. no. be in a sorely mangle condition but be much bad. she be reduce to a shell be a very elle woman of an engine bear only her funnel the iron frame and the saddle that support the boiler. 
four and twenty engine in every stage of decomposition stand in one huge shop. a travel crane run overhead and the men have haul up one end of a bright vermilion loco. the effect be the silence of a scornful stare just such a look a a colonel s portly wife give through her pince nez at the audacious subaltern. engine be the liv thing that man ever make. they glare through their spectacle plate they tilt their nose contemptuously and when their inside be go they adorn themselves with red lead and leer like decay beauty. and in the jamalpur work there be no escape from them. the shop can hold fifty without pressure and on occasion a many again. everywhere there be engine and everywhere brass dome lie about on the grind like huge helmet in a pantomime. the silence be the weird touch of all. some sprightly soul an apprentice be sure ha daub in red lead on the end of an iron tool box a caricature of some friend who be evidently a riveter. the picture ha all the interest of an egyptian cartouche for it show that men have be here and that the engine do not have it all their own way. 
and so out in the open away from the three great shed between and under more engine till we strike a wilderness of line all converge to one turn table. here be elephant stall range round a half circle and in each stall stand one engine and each engine stare at the turn table. a stolid and disconcert company be this ring of eye monster. and be shin like toy. they be ready for their turn of duty and be a spruce a hansom. lacquer chocolate pick out with black red and white be their dress and delicate lemon grace the ceiling of the cab. the driver should be a gentleman in even dress with white kid glove and there should be gold head champagne bottle in the spick and span tender. huckleberry finn say of a timber raft it amount to something be captain of that raft. thrice enviable be the man who draw r. a month be allow to make r. overtime out of locos no. or. fifty yard beyond this gorgeous trinity be ten to twelve engine who have put in to jamalpur to bait. they be alive their fire be light and they be swear and purr and growl one at another a they stand alone. here be evidently one of the new type no. a giant who ha just bring the mail in and wait to be clean up preparatory to go out afresh. 
the tiffin hour ha end. the buzzer blow and with a roar a rattle and a clang the shop take up their toil. the hubbub that follow on the prince s kiss to the sleep beauty be not so loud or sudden. experience with a foot rule in his pocket authority in his port and a merry twinkle in his eye come up and catch ignorance walk gingerly round no. that s one of the best we have say experience a four wheel couple bogie they call her. she s by dobbs. she s do her hundred and fifty mile to day. and she ll run in to rampore haut this afternoon. then she ll rest a day and be clean up. roughly she doe her three hundred mile in the four and twenty hour. she s a beauty. she s out from home but we can build our own engine all except the wheel. we re build ten locos. now and we ve get a dozen boiler ready if you care to look at them. how long doe a loco. last. that s just a may be. she will do a much a her driver let her. some men play the mischief with a loco. and some handle em properly. our driver prefer hawthorne s old four wheel couple engine because they give the least bother. there be one in that shed and it s a good un to travel. but eighty thousand mile generally see the gloss off an engine and she go into the shop to be overhaul and refit and replaned and a lot of thing that you wouldn t understand if i tell you about them. no. the first loco. on the line be run still but very little of the original engine must be leave by this time. that one there come out in the mutiny year. she s by slaughter and grunning and she s build for speed in front of a light load. french look sort of thing isn t she. that s because her cylinder be on a tilt. we use her for the mail once but the mail ha grow heavy and heavy and now we use six wheel couple eighteen inch inside cylinder ton locos. to shift thousand ton train. no. all locos. aren t alike. it isn t merely pull a lever. the company like it driver to know their locos. and a man will keep his hawthorne for two or three year. the more mileage he get out of her before she ha to be overhaul the good man he be. it pay to let a man have his fancy engine. a man must take an interest in his loco. and that mean she must belong to him. some locos. win t do anything even if you coax and humour them. i don t think there be any unlucky one now but some year ago no. wasn t popular. the driver go sick or take leave when they be tell off for her. she kill her driver on the jubbulpore line she leave the rail at kajra she do something or other at rampur haut and lord know what she didn t do or try to do in other place. all the driver fight shy of her and in the end she disappear. they say she be condemn but i shouldn t wonder if the company change her number quietly and change the luck at the same time. you see the government inspector come and look at our stock now and again and when an engine s condemn he put his dhobi mark on her and she s break up. well no. be condemn but there be a whisper that they only shift her number and run her out again. when the driver didn t know there be no accident. i don t think we ve get an unlucky one run now. some be different from others but there be no man eater. yes a driver of the mail be somebody. he can make r. a month if he s a covenant man. we get a lot of our driver in the country and we don t import from england a much a we do. stand to reason that now there s more competition both among line and in the labour market the company can t afford to be a generous a it use to be. it doesn t cheat a man though. it s this way with the driver. a native driver get about r. a month and in his way he s suppose to be good enough for branch work and shunt and such. well an english driver ll get from r. to r. and overtime. the english driver know what the native get and in time they tell the driver that the native ll improve. the driver ha that to think of. you see. that s competition. 
experience return to the engine shed now full of clamour and enlarge on the beauty of sick locomotive. the fitter and the assistant and the apprentice be hammer and punch and gauge and otherwise technically disport themselves round their enormous patient and their language a catch in snatch be beautifully unintelligible. 
but one fly sentence go straight to the heart. it be the cry of humanity over the task of life do into unrefined english. an apprentice grime to his eyebrow his cloth cap well on the back of his curly head and his hand deep in his pocket be sit on the edge of a tool box ruefully regard the very much disorganise engine whose slave be he. a handsome boy this apprentice and well make. he whistle softly between his teeth and his brow pucker. then he address the engine half in expostulation and half in despair oh you condemn old female dog. he put the sentence more crisply much more crisply and ignorance chuckle sympathetically. 
ignorance also be puzzle over these engine. 
chapter iii. 
vulcan s forge. 
in the wilderness of the railway shop and machinery that plane and shave and bevel and stamp and punch and hoist and nip the first idea that occur to an outsider when he ha see the men who people the place be that it must be the birthplace of invention a pasture grind of fat patent. if a write man who play with shadow and dress doll that others may laugh at their antic draw help and comfort and new method of work old idea from the store shelf of a library how in the name of commonsense his god can a do man whose mind be set upon thing that snatch a few moment from fly time or put power into weak hand refrain from go forward and add new invention to the hundred among which he daily move. 
appeal to on this subject experience who have serve the e. i. r. loyally for many year hold his peace. we don t go in much for patent. but he add with a praiseworthy attempt to turn the conversation we can build you any mortal thing you like. we ve get the bradford leslie steamer for the sahibgunge ferry. come and see the brass work for her bow. it s in the cast shed. 
it would have be cruel to have press experience further and ignorance to foredate matter a little go about to discover why experience shy off this question and why the men of jamalpur have not each and all invent and patent something. he win his information in the end but do not come from jamalpur. that must be clearly understand. it be find anywhere you please between howrah and hoti mardan. and here it be that all the world may admire a prudent and far sight board of director. once upon a time a every one in the profession know two men invent the d. and o. sleeper cast iron of five piece very serviceable. the men be in the company s employ and their master say. your brain be ours. hand u over those sleeper. be of pay and position d. and o. make some sort of resistance and get a royalty or a bonus. at any rate the company have to pay for it sleeper. but thereafter and the condition exist to this day they cause it to be write in each servant s covenant that if by chance he invent aught his invention be to belong to the company. providence ha mercifully arrange that no man or syndicate of men can buy the holy spirit of man outright without suffer in some way or another just a much a the purchase. america fully and germany in part recognise this law. the e. i. railway s breach of it be thoroughly english. they say or it be say of them that they say we be afraid of our men who belong to u waste their time on try to invent. 
be it wholly impossible then for men of mechanical experience and large sympathy to check the mere patent hunter and bring forward the man with an idea. be there no supervision in the shop or have the men who play tennis and billiards at the institute not a minute which they can rightly call their very own. would it ruin the rich company in india to lend their model shop and their lathe to half a dozen or for the matter of that half a hundred abortive experiment. a massachusetts organ factory a racine buggy shop an oregon lumber yard would laugh at the notion. an american toy maker might swindle an employ√© after the invention but he would in his own interest help the man to see what come of the thing. surely a wealthy a powerful and a all jamalpur bear witness a considerate company might cut that clause out of the covenant and await the issue. there would be quite enough jealousy between man and man grade and grade to keep down all but the keen soul. and with due respect to the steam hammer and the roll mill we have not yet make machinery perfect. the shop be not likely to spawn unmanageable stephenson or grasp brunels. but in the minor turn of mechanical think that find concrete expression in link axle box joint packing valve and spring stirrup something might something would be do be the practical prohibition remove. will a north countryman give you anything but warm hospitality for nothing. or if you claim from him overtime service a a right will he work zealously. onything but t brass be his motto and his idea be his brass. 
gentleman in authority if this should meet your august eye spare it a minute s think and clear away the floridity get to the heart of the mistake and see if it cannot be rationally put right. above all remember that jamalpur supply no information. it be a mute a an oyster. there be no one within your jurisdiction to ahem drop upon. 
let u after this excursion into the office return to the shop and only ask experience such question a he can without disloyalty answer. 
we use once say he lead to the foundry to sell our old rail and import new one. even when we use em for roof beam and so on we have more than we know what to do with. now we have get roll mill and we use the rail to make tie bar for the d. and o. sleeper and all sort of thing. we turn out five hundred d. and o. sleeper a day. altogether we use about seventy five ton of our own iron a month here. iron in calcutta cost about five eight a hundredweight. ours cost between three four and three eight and on that item alone we save three thousand a month. don t ask me how many mile of rail we own. there be fifteen hundred mile of line and you can make your own calculation. all those thing like baby graf down in that shed be the mould for the d. and o. sleeper. we test them by drop three hundredweight and three hundred quarter of iron on top of them from a height of seven foot or eleven sometimes. they don t often smash. we have a notion here that our iron be a good a the home stuff. 
a sleek white and brindled pariah thrust himself into the conversation. his house appear to be on the warm ash of the bolt maker. this be a horrible machine which chew red hot iron bar and spit them out perfect bolt. it manner be disgust and it gobble over it food. 
hi jack. say experience stroke the interloper you ve be try to break your leg again. that s the dog of the work. at least he make believe that the work belong to him. he ll follow any one of u about the shop a far a the gate but never a step further. you can see he s in first class condition. the boy give him his ticket and one of these day he ll try to get on to the company s book a a regular worker. he s too clever to live. jack head the procession a far a the wall of the roll shed and then return to his machinery room. he waddle with fatness and despise stranger. 
how would you like to be hot pot there. say experience who ha read and who be enthusiastic over she_ a he point to the great furnace whence the slag be be drag out by hook. here be the old material go into the furnace in that big iron bucket. look at the scrap of iron. there s an old d. and o. sleeper there s a lot of clip from a cylinder there s a lot of snip up rail there s a drive wheel block there s an old hook and a sprinkle of boiler plate and rivet. 
the bucket be tip into the furnace with a thunderous roar and the slag below pour forth more quickly. an engine say experience reflectively can run over herself so to say. after she s break up she be make into sleeper for the line. you ll see how she s break up late. a few pace further on semi nude demon be caper over strip of glow hot iron which be put into a mill a rail and emerge a thin shapely tie bar. the native wear rough sandal and some pretence of apron but the great part of them be all face. a i say before say experience a native s cuteness when he s work on ticket be something startle. beyond occasionally hang on to a red hot bar too long and so let their pincer be draw through the mill these men take precious good care not to go wrong. our machinery be fence and guard rail a much a possible and these men don t get catch up by the belt. in the first place they re careful the father warn the son and so on and in the second there s nothing about em for the belt to catch on unless the man shove his hand in. oh a native s no fool. he know that it doesn t do to be foolish when he s deal with a crane or a drive wheel. you re look at all those chop rail. we make our iron a they blend baccy. we mix up all sort to get the require quality. those rail have just be chop by this tobacco cutter thing. experience bend down and set a vicious look parrot head beam to work. there be a quiver a snap and a dull smash and a heavy rail be nip in two like a stick of barley sugar. 
elsewhere a bull nose hydraulic cutter be rail cut a if it enjoy the fun. in another shed stand the steam hammer. the unemployed one murmur and mutter to themselves a be the uncanny custom of all steam souled machinery. experience with his hand on a long lever make one of the monster perform. and though ignorance know that a man design and men do continually build steam hammer the effect be a though experience be madden a chain beast. the massive block slide down the guide only to pause hungrily an inch above the anvil or restlessly throb through a foot and a half of space each motion be control by an almost imperceptible handle of the lever. when these thing be newly overhaul you can regulate your blow to within an eighth of an inch say experience. we have a foreman here once who could work em beautifully. he have the touch. one day a visitor no end of a swell in a tall white hat come round the work and our foreman borrow the hat and bring the hammer down just enough to press the nap and no more. how wonderful. say the visitor put his hand carelessly upon this lever rod here. experience suit the action to the word and the hammer thunder on the anvil. well you can guess for yourself. next minute there wasn t enough leave of that tall white hat to make a postage stamp of. steam hammer aren t thing to play with. now we ll go over to the store. 
whatever apparent disorder there might have be in the work the store department be a clean a a new pin and stupefy in it naval order. copper plate bar angle and rod iron duplicate crank and slide bar the piston rod of the bradford leslie steamer engine grease file and hammer head every conceivable article from leather lace of belting to head lamp necessary for the due and proper work of a long line be stock stack pile and put away in appropriate compartment. in the midst of it all neck deep in ledger and indent form stand the many hand babu the steam of the engine whose power extend from howrah to ghaziabad. 
the company doe everything and know everything. the gallant apprentice may be a wild youth with an earnest desire to go occasionally upon the bend. but three time a week between and p. m. he must attend the night school and sit at the foot of m. bonnaud who teach him mechanic and static so thoroughly that even the awful government inspector be please. and when there be no night school the company will by no mean wash it hand of it men out of work hour. no man can be violently restrain from go to the bad if he insist upon it but in the service of the company a man ha every warn. his escapade be know and a judiciously arrange transfer sometimes keep a good fellow clear of the down grade. no one can flat himself that in the multitude he be overlook or believe that between p. m. and a. m. he be at liberty to misdemean himself. sooner or late but generally sooner his going on be know and he be remind that briton never shall be slave to thing that destroy good work a well a soul. maybe the company act only in it own interest but the result be good. 
best and pretty of the many good and pretty thing in jamalpur be the institute of a saturday when the volunteer band be play and the tennis court be full and the babydom of jamalpur fat sturdy child frolic round the band stand. the people dance but big a the institute be it be get too small for their dance they act they play billiards they study their newspaper they play card and everything else and they flirt in a sumptuous build and in the hot weather the gallant apprentice duck his friend in the big swim bath. decidedly the railway folk make their life pleasant. 
let u go down southward to the big giridih colliery and see the coal that feed the furnace that smelt the iron that make the sleeper that bear the loco. that pull the carriage that hold the freight that come from the country that be make rich by the great company badahur the east indian railway. 
the giridih coal field. 
chapter i. 
on the surface. 
southward always southward and easterly run the calcutta mail from luckeeserai till she reach madapur in the sonthal parganas. from madapur a train largely make up of coal truck head westward into the hazaribagh district and toward giridih. a week would not have exhaust jamalpur and it environ a the guide book say. but since time drive and man must e en be drive the weird echo bund in the hill above jamalpur where the owl hoot at night and hyena come down to laugh over the grave of quilem robert who die from the effect of an encounter with a tiger near this place a. d. go undescribed. nor be it possible to deal with monghyr the headquarter of the district where one see for the first time the age of old bengal in the sleepy creepy station build in a time eat fort which run out into the gang and be full of quaint house with fat legged balustrade on the roof. pensioner certainly and probably a score of ghost live in monghyr. all the country seem haunt. be there not at pir bahar a lonely house on a bluff the grave of a young lady who thirty year ago ride her horse down the cliff and perish. ha not monghyr a haunt house in which tradition say sceptic have see much more than they could account for. and be it not notorious throughout the countryside that the seven mile of road between jamalpur and monghyr be nightly parade by tramp battalion of spectre phantom of an old time army massacre who know how long ago. the common voice attest all these thing and an eerie cemetery pack with blacken lichened candle extinguisher tomb stone persuade the listener to believe all that he hear. bengal be second or third be it. in order of seniority among the province and like an old nurse she tell many witch tale. 
but ghost have nothing to do with colliery and that ever present company the e. i. r. ha more or le make giridih principally more. before the e. i. r. come say the people we have one meal a day. now we have two. stomach do not tell fib whatever mouth may say. that company in the course of business throw about five lakh a year into the hazaribagh district in the form of wage alone and giridih bazaar ha to supply the want of twelve thousand men woman and child. but we have now the authority of a number of high souled and intelligent native print that the sahib of all grade spend his time in suck the blood out of the country and fly to england to spend his ill get gain. 
giridih be perfectly mad quite insane. geologically the country be in the metamorphic high ground that rise out of the alluvial flat of low bengal between the osri and the barakar river. translate this sentence mean that you can twist your ankle on piece of pure white pinky and yellowish granite slip over weather wear sandstone grievously cut your boot over flake of trap and throw hornblende pebble at the dog. never be such a place for stone throw a giridih. the general aspect of the country be falsely park like because it swell and sink in a score of grass cover undulation and be adorn with plantation like jungle. there be low hill on every side and twelve mile away bear south the blue bulk of the holy hill of parasnath great of the jain tirthankars overlook the world. in bengal they consider four thousand five hundred foot good enough for a dagshai or kasauli and once upon a time they try to put troop on parasnath. there be a scarcity of water and thomas of those day find the silence and seclusion prey upon his spirit. since twenty year therefore parasnath ha be abandon by her majesty s army. 
a to giridih itself the last few mile of train bring up the reek of the black country. memory depend on smell. a noseless man be devoid of sentiment just a a noseless woman in this country must be devoid of honour. that first breath of the coal should be the breath of the murky cloud tract between yeadon and dale or barnsley rough and hospitable barnsley or dewsbury and batley and the derby canal on a sunday afternoon when the wheel be still and the young men and maiden walk stolidly in pair. unfortunately it be nothing more than giridih seven thousand mile away from home and bless with a warm and genial sunshine soon to turn into something very much bad. the insanity of the place be visible at the station door. a g. b. t. cart once marry a bath machine and they call the child tum tum. you who in flannel and cawnpore harness drive bamboo cart about up country road remember that a giridih tum tum be painfully push by four men and must be enter crawl on all four head first. so strange be the way of bengal. 
they drive mad horse in giridih animal that become hysterical a soon a the dusk fall and the countryside blaze with the fire of the great coke oven. if you expostulate tearfully they produce another horse a raw red fiend whose ear ha to be screw round and round and round and round before she will by any manner of mean consent to start. the road carry neat little eighteen inch trench at their side admirably adapt to hold the fly wheel. skirl about this savage land in the dark the white population beguile the time by rapturously recount past accident insist throughout on the super equine steadiness of their cattle. deep and broad and wide be their jovial hospitality. but somebody the tirhoot planter for choice ought to start a mission to teach the men of giridih what to drive. they know how_ or they would be severally and separately and many time dead but they do not they do not indeed know that animal who stand on one hind leg and beckon with all the rest or try to pigstick in harness be not trap horse worthy of endear name but thing to be pole ax. their feeling be hurt when you say this. sit tight say the men of giridih. we re insure. we can t be hurt. 
and now with grey hair dry mouth and chatter teeth to the colliery. the e. i. r. estate buy or lease in perpetuity from the serampore raja may be about four mile long and between one and two mile across. it be in two piece the serampore field be separate from the karharbari. or kurhurballi or kabarbari. field by the property of the bengal coal company. the raneegunge coal association lie to the east of all other working. so we have three company at work on about eleven square mile of land. 
there be no such thing a get a full view of the whole place. a short walk over a grassy down give on to an outcrop of very dirty sandstone which in the excessive innocence of his heart the visitor naturally take to be the coal lie neatly on the surface. up to this sandstone the path seem to be make of crush sugar so white and shiny be the quartz. over the brow of the down come in sight the old familiar pit head wheel spin for the dear life and the eye lose itself in a maze of pump shed red tile mud wall miner hut dot all over the landscape and railway line that run on every kind of gradient. there be line that dip into valley and disappear round the shoulder of slope and line that career on the top of rise and disappear over the brow of the slope. along these line whistle and pant metre gauge engine some with truck at their tail and others rattle back to the pit bank with the absurd air of a boy late for school that an unemployed engine always assume. there be six engine in all and a it be easy to walk along the line one see a good deal of them. they bear not altogether unfamiliar name. here for instance pass the cockburn whistle down a grade with thirty ton of coal at her heel. while the whitly and the olpherts be wait for their complement of truck. now a mr. t. f. cockburn be superintendent of these mine nearly thirty year ago in the day before the chord line from kanu to luckeeserai be build and all the coal be cart to the latter place. and surely mr. olpherts be an engineer who help to think out a new sleeper. what may these thing mean. 
apotheosis of the manager be the reply. christen the engine after the manager. you ll find cockburn dunn whitly abbott olpherts and saise knock about the place. sound funny doesn t it. doesn t sound so funny when one of these idiot doe his best to derail saise though by put a line down anyhow. look at that line. lay out in knot by jove. to the unprofessional eye the rail seem all correct. but there must be something wrong because one of those idiot be ask why in the name of all he consider sacred he doe not ram the ballast properly. 
what would happen if you throw an engine off the line. can t say that i know exactly. you see our business be to keep them on_ and we do that. here s rather a curiosity. you see that pointsman. they say he s an old mutineer and when he relax he boast of the sahib he ha kill. he s glad enough to eat the company s salt now. such a wither old face be the face of the pointsman at no. point. the information suggest a host of question and the answer be these. you win t be able to understand till you ve be down into a mine. we work our men in two way. some by direct payment under our own hand and some by contractor. the contractor undertake to deliver u the coal supply his own men tool and prop. he s responsible for the safety of his men and of course the company know and see his work. just fancy among these five thousand people what sort of effect the news of an accident would produce. it would go all through the sonthal parganas. we have any amount of sonthals besides mahometans and hindu of every possible caste down to those musahers who eat pig. they don t require much administer in the civilian sense of the word. on sunday a a rule if any man ha have his daughter elope with or anything of that kind he generally come up to the manager s bungalow to get the matter put straight. if a man be disable through accident he know that a long a he s in the hospital he get full wage and the company pay for the food of any of his woman folk who come to look after him. one_ of course. not the whole clan. that make our service popular with the people. don t you believe that a native be a fool. you can train him to everything except responsibility. there s a rule in the working that if there be any dangerous work we haven t choke damp. i will show you when we get down no gang must work without an englishman to look after them. a native wouldn t be wise enough to understand what the danger be or where it come in. even if he do he d shirk the responsibility. we can t afford to risk a single life. all our output be just a much a the company want about a thousand ton per work day. three hundred thousand in the year. we could turn out more. yes a little. well yes twice a much. i win t go on because you wouldn t believe me. there s the coal under u and we work it at any depth from follow up an outcrop down to six hundred foot. that be our deep shaft. we have no necessity to go deep. at home the mine be sometimes fifteen hundred foot down. well the thickness of this coal here vary from anything you please to anything you please. there s enough of it to last your time and one or two hundred year long. perhaps even long than that. look at that stuff. that s big coal from the pit. 
it be aristocratic look coal just like the pick lump that be stack in basket of coal agency at home with the print legend atop only s a ton. but there be no pick in this case. the great pile bank be all equal to sample and beyond them lay pile of small break smithy coal. the company doesn t sell to the public. this small break coal be an exception. that be sell but the big stuff be for the engine and the shop. it doesn t cost much to get out a you say. but our men can earn a much a twelve rupee a month. very often when they ve earn enough to go on with they retire from the concern till they ve spend their money and then come on again. it s piece work and they be improvident. if some of them only live like other native they would have enough to buy land and cow with. when there s a press of work they make a good deal by overtime but they don t seem to keep it. you should see giridih bazaar on a sunday if you want to know where the money go. about ten thousand rupee change hand once a week there. if you want to get at the number of people who be indirectly dependent or profit by the e. i. r. you ll have to conduct a census of your own. after sunday be over the men generally lie off on monday and take it easy on tuesday. then they work hard for the next four day and make it up. of course there s nothing in the wide world to prevent a man from resign and go away to wherever he come from behind those hill if he s a sonthal. he lose his employment that s all. but they have their own point of honour. a man hate to be tell by his friend that he ha be guilty of shirk. and now we ll go to breakfast. you shall be pit to morrow to any depth you like. 
chapter ii. 
in the depth. 
pit to any extent you please. the only difficulty be for joseph to choose his pit. giridih be full of them. there be an arch in the side of a little hill a blacken brick arch lead into thick night. a stationary engine be haul a procession of coal lade truck tub be the technical word out of it depth. the tub be neither pretty nor clean. we be go down in those when they be empty. put on your helmet and keep it on and keep your head down. 
there be nothing mirth provoke in go down a coal mine even though it be only a shallow incline run to one hundred and forty foot vertical below the earth. get into the tub and lie down. hang it no. this be not a railway carriage. you can t see the country out of the window. lie down in the dust and don t lift your head. let her go. 
the tub strain on the wire rope and slide down fourteen hundred foot of incline at first through a chasten gloom and then through darkness. an absurd sentence from a trial report ring in the head. about this time prisoner express a desire for the consolation of religion. a hand with a reek flare lamp hang over the edge of the tub and there be a glimpse of a blacken hat near it for those accustom to the pit have a merry trick of go down sit or crouch on the couple of the rear tub. the noise be deafen and the roof be very close indeed. the tub bump and the occupant crouch lovingly in the coal dust. what would happen if the train go off the line. the desire for the consolation of religion grow keen and keen a the air grow close and close. the tub stop in darkness spangle by the light of the flare lamp which many black devil carry. underneath and on both side be the greasy blackness of the coal and above a roof of grey sandstone smooth a the flow of a river at even. now remember that if you don t keep your hat on you ll get your head break because you will forget to stoop. if you hear any tub come up behind you step off to one side. there s a tramway under your foot. be careful not to trip over it. 
the miner ha a gait a peculiarly his own a tommy s measure pace or the bluejacket s roll. big men who slouch in the light of day become almost thing of beauty underground. their foot be on their native heather. and the slouch be a very necessary act of homage to the great earth which if a man observe not he shall without doubt have his hat bless the man who invent pith hat. grievously cut. 
the road turn and wind and the roof become low but those accurse tub still rattle by on the tramway. the roof throw back their noise and when all the place be full of a grumble and a growl how under earth be one to know whence danger will turn up next. the air bring to the unacclimatised a sing in the ear a hotness of the eyeball and a jump of the heart. that s because the pressure here be different from the pressure up above. it ll wear off in a minute. we don t notice it. wait till you get down a four hundred foot pit. then your ear will begin to sing if you like. 
most people know the one night of each hot weather that still cloud night just before the rain break when there seem to be no more breathable air under the bowl of the pitiless sky and all the weight of the silent dark house lie on the chest of the sleep hunter. this be the feel in a coal mine only more so much more so for the darkness be the gross darkness of the inner sepulchre. it be hard to see which be the black coal and which the passage drive through it. from far away down the side gallery come the regular beat of the pick thick and muffle a the beat of the labour heart. six men to a gang and they aren t allow to work alone. they make six foot drive through the coal two and sometimes three men work together. the rest clear away the stuff and load it into the tub. we have no prop in this gallery because we have a roof a good a a ceiling. the coal lie under the sandstone here. it s beautiful sandstone. it be beautiful sandstone a hard a a billiard table and devoid of any nasty little bump and jag. 
there be a roar down one road the roar of infernal fire. this be not a pleasant thing to hear in the dark. it be too suggestive. that s our ventilate shaft. can t you feel the air get brisk. come and look. 
imagine a great iron bind crate of burn coal hang over a gulf of darkness faintly show the brickwork of the base of a chimney. we re at the bottom of the shaft. that fire make a draught that suck up the foul air from the bottom of the pit. there s another down draw shaft in another part of the mine where the clean air come in. we aren t go to set the mine on fire. there s an earth and brick floor at the bottom of the pit. the crate hang over. it isn t so deep a you think. then a devil a naked devil come in with a pitchfork and feed the spout flame. this be perfectly in keep with the landscape. 
more truck more muffle noise more darkness make visible and more devil male and female come out of darkness and vanish. then a picture to be remember. a great hall of eblis twenty foot from inky black floor to grey roof uphold by huge pillar of shin coal and fill with flit and pass devil. on a shatter pillar near the roof stand a naked man his flesh olive colour in the light of the lamp hew down a mass of coal that still cleave to the roof. behind him be the wall of darkness and when the lamp shift he disappear like a ghost. the devil be shout direction and the man howl in reply rest on his pick and wipe the sweat from his brow. when he smite the coal crush and slide and rumble from the darkness into the darkness and the devil cry shabash. the man stand erect like a bronze statue he twist and bend himself like a japanese grotesque and anon throw himself on his side after the manner of the die gladiator. then speak the still small voice of fact. a first class workman if he would only stick to it. but a soon a he make a little money he lie off and spend it. that s the last of a pillar that we ve knock out. see here. these pillar of coal be square about thirty foot each way. a you can see we make the pillar first by cut out all the coal between. then we drive two square tunnel about seven foot wide through and across the pillar prop it with balk. there s one fresh cut. 
two tunnel cross at right angle have be drive through a pillar which in it under cut condition seem like the rough draft of a statue for an elephant. when the pillar stand only on four leg we chip away one leg at a time from a square to an hour glass shape and then either the whole of the pillar crash down from the roof or else a quarter or a half. if the coal lie against the sandstone it carry away clear but in some place it bring down stone and rubbish with it. the chip away leg of the pillar be call stooks. 
who ha to make the last cut that break a leg through. 
oh. englishman of sort. we can t trust native for the job unless it s very easy. the native take kindly to the pillar work though. they be pay just a much for their coal a though they have hew it out of the solid. of course we take very good care to see that the roof doesn t come in on u. you would never understand how and why we prop our roof with those pile of sleeper. anyway you can see that we cannot take out a whole line of pillar. we work em en echelon_ and those big beam you see run from floor to roof be our indicator. they show when the roof be go to give. oh. dear no there s no dramatic effect about it. no splash you know. our roof give plenty of warn by crack and then collapse slowly. the part of the work that we have clear out and allow to fall in be call goafs. you re on the edge of a goaf now. all that darkness there mark the limit of the mine. we have work that out piece meal and the prop be go and the place be down. the roof of any pillar work be test every morning by tap pretty hard tap. 
hi yi. yi. shout all the devil in chorus and the hall of eblis be full of roll sound. the olive man ha bring down an avalanche of coal. it be a sight to see the whole of one of the pillar come away. they make an awful noise. it would startle you out of your wit. but there s not an atom of risk. 
not an atom of risk. oh genial and courteous host when you turn up next day black than any sweep that ever sweep with a neat half inch gash on your forehead win by cut a stook and get catch by a bound coal knob how long and earnestly do you endeavour to show that stook cut be an employment a harmless and unexciting a wool samplering. 
our way be rather primitive but they re cheap and safe a house. doms and bauris kols and beldars don t understand refinement in mine. they d startle an english pit where there be fire damp. do you know it s a solemn fact that if you drop a davy lamp or snatch it quickly you can blow a whole english pit inside out with all the miner. good for u that we don t know what fire damp be here. we can use flare lamp. 
after the first feel of awe and wonder be wear out a mine become monotonous. there be only the hum palpitate darkness the rumble of the tub and the endless procession of gallery to arrest the attention. and one pit to the uninitiated be a like to another a two pea. tell a miner this and he laugh slowly and softly. to him the pit have each distinct personality and each must be deal with differently. 
chapter iii. 
the peril of the pit. 
an engineer who ha build a bridge can strike you nearly dead with professional fact. the captain of a seventy horse power gang river steamer can in one hour tell legend of the sandheads and the jam and mary shoal sufficient to fill half a pioneer_ but a couple of day spend on above and in a coal mine yield more mix information than two engineer and three captain. it be hopeless to pretend to understand it all. 
when your host say ah such an one be a thunder good fault reader. you smile hazily and by way of keep up the conversation adventure on the statement that fault read and palmistry be very popular amusement. then men explain. 
every one know that coal stratum in common with woman horse and official superior have fault cause by some colic of the earth in the day when thing be settle into their place. a coal seam be suddenly slice off a a pencil be cut through with one slant blow of the penknife and one half be either push up or push down any number of foot. the miner work the seam till they come to this break off and then call for an expert to read the fault. it be sometimes very hard to discover whether the slice off seam ha go up or down. theoretically the end of the break piece should show the direction. practically it indication be not always clear. then a good fault reader who must more than know geology be a useful man and be much prize. for the giridih field be full of fault and dyke. tongue of what be once melt lava thrust themselves sheer into the coal and the disgust miner find that for about twenty foot on each side of the tongue all coal ha be burn away. 
the head of the mine be suppose to foresee these thing and more. he can tell you without look at the map what be the geological formation of any thousand square mile of india. he know a much about brickwork and the build of house arch and shaft a an average p. w. d. man. he ha not only to know the intestine of a pump or wind engine but must be able to take them to piece with his own hand indicate on the spot such part a need repair and make drawing of anything that require renewal. he know how to lay out and build railway with a grade of one in twenty seven. he ha to carry in his head all the signal and point between and over which his locomotive engine work. he must be an electrician capable of control the apparatus that fire the dynamite charge in the pit and must thoroughly understand bore operation with thousand foot drill. he must know by name at least one thousand of the men on the work and must fluently speak the vernacular of the low caste. if he ha sonthali which be more elaborate than greek so much the good for him. he must know how to handle men of all grade and while hold himself aloof must posse sufficient grip of the men s private life to be able to see at once the merit of a charge of attempt abduction prefer by a cluck croak kol against a fluent english speak brahmin. for he be literally the light of justice and to him the injure husband and the wrathful father look for redress. he must be on the spot and take all responsibility when any specially risky job be under way in the pit and he can claim no single hour of the day or the night for his own. from eight in the morning till one in the afternoon he be coat with coal dust and oil. from one till eight in the even he ha office work. after eight o clock he be free to attend to anything that he may be want for. 
this be a soberly draw picture of a life that sahib on the mine actually enjoy. they be spar all private socio official worry for the company in it mixture of state and private interest be a perfectly cold blood and devoid of bias a any great department of the empire. if certain thing be do well and good. if certain thing be not do the defaulter go and his place be fill by another. the condition of service be grave on stone. there may be generosity. there undoubtedly be justice but above all there be freedom within broad limit. no irrepressible shareholder cripple the executive arm with suggestion and restriction and no private pique turn men s blood to gall within them. they work like horse and be happy. 
when he can snatch a free hour the grimy sweat cardigan jacket ammunition boot pick bear ruffian turn into a well keep english gentleman who play a good game of billiards and ha a batch of new book from england every week. the change be sudden but in giridih nothing be startle. it be right and natural that a man should be alternately valentine and orson specially orson. it be right and natural to drive always behind a mad horse away and away towards the lonely hill till the flame coke oven become glow worm on the dark horizon and in the wilderness to find a lovely english maiden teach squat filthy sonthal girl how to become christian. nothing be strange in giridih and the story of the pit the raffle of conversation that a man pick up a he pass be quite in keep with the place. thank to the law which enact that an englishman must look after the native miner and if any one be kill must explain satisfactorily that the accident be not due to preventable cause the death roll be keep astoundingly low. in one bad half year six men out of the five thousand be kill in another four and in another none at all. a ha be say before a big accident would scare off the worker for in spite of the age of the mine nearly thirty year the hereditary pitman ha not yet be evolve. but to small accident the men be orientally apathetic. read of a death among the five thousand. 
a gang ha be order to cut clay for the luting of the coke furnace. the clay be pile in a huge bank in the open sunlight. a coolie hack and hack till he ha hew out a small cave with twenty foot of clay above him. why should he trouble to climb up the bank and bring down the eave of the cave. it be easy to cut in. the sirdar of the gang be watch round the shoulder of the bank. the coolie cut lazily a he stand. sunday be very near and he will get gloriously drink in giridih bazaar with his week s earn. he dig his own grave stroke by stroke for he ha not sense enough to see that undercut clay be dangerous. he be a sonthal from the hill. there be a smash and a dull thud and his grave ha shut down upon him in an avalanche of heavy cake clay. 
the sirdar call to the babu of the oven and with the promptitude of his race the babu lose his head. he run puffily without give order anywhere everywhere. finally he run to the sahib s house. the sahib be at the other end of the colliery. he run back. the sahib ha go home to wash. then his indiscretion strike him. he should have send runner fleet foot boy from the coal screen gang. he send them and they fly. one catch the sahib just change after his bath. there be a man dead at such a place he gasp omit to say whether it be a surface or a pit accident. on go the grimy pit kit and in three minute the sahib s dogcart be fly to the place indicate. 
they have dig out the sonthal. his head be smash in spine and breastbone be break and the gang sirdar bow double throw the blame of the accident on the poor shapeless batter dead. i have warn him but he would not listen. twice i warn him. these men be witness. 
the babu be shake like a jelly. oh sar i have never see a man kill before. look at that eye sar. i should have send runner. i run everywhere. i run to your house. you be not in. i be run for hour. it be not my fault. it be the fault of the gang sirdar. he wring his hand and gurgle. the best of accountant but the poor of coroner be he. no need to ask how the accident happen. no need to listen to the sirdar and his witness. the sonthal have be a fool but it be the sirdar s business to protect him against his own folly. ha he any people here. 
yes his rukni_ his keep woman and his sister s brother in law. his home be far off. 
the sister s brother in law break through the crowd howl for vengeance on the sirdar. he will send for the police he will have the price of his brother s blood full tale. the windmill arm and the angry eye fall for the sahib be make the report of the death. 
will the government give me pensin. i be his wife a woman clamour stamp her pewter ankleted foot. he be kill in your service. where be his pensin. i be his wife. 
you lie. you re his rukni. keep quiet. go. the pension come to u. 
the sister s brother in law be not a refine man but the rukni be his match. they be silence. the sahib take the report and the body be bear away. before to morrow s sun rise the gang sirdar may find himself a simple surface coolie earn nine pice a day. and in a week some sonthal woman behind the hill may discover that she be entitle to draw monthly great wealth from the coffer of the sirkar. but this will not happen if the sister s brother in law can prevent it. he go off swear at the rukni. 
in the meantime what have the rest of the dead man s gang be do. they have if you please abate not one stroke dig out all the clay and would have it verify. they have see their comrade die. he be dead. bus. [ ] will the sirdar take the tale of clay. and yet be twenty men to be crush by their own carelessness in the pit these same impassive worker would scatter like panic stricken horse. 
[ ] enough. 
turn from this sketch let u set in order a few story of the pit. in some of the mine the coal be blast out by the dynamite which be fire by electricity from a battery on the surface. two men place the charge and then signal to be draw up in the cage which hang in the pit eye. once two native be intrust with the job. they perform their part beautifully till the end when the vast idiot of the two scramble into the cage give signal and be haul up before his friend could follow. 
thirty or forty yard up the shaft all possible danger for those in the cage be over and the charge be accordingly explode. then it occur to the man in the cage that his friend stand a very good chance of be by this time rive to piece and choke. 
but the friend be wise in his generation. he have miss the cage but find a coal tub one of the little iron truck and turn this upside down crawl into it. when the charge go off his shelter be batter in so much that men have to hack him out for the tub have make a it be a tin sardine of it occupant. he be absolutely unhurt but for his feeling. on reach the pit bank his first word be i do not desire to go down to the pit with that man any more. his wish have be already gratify for that man have flee. late on the story go when that man find that the guilt of murder be not at his door he return and be make a mere surface coolie and his brother jeer at him a they pass to their good pay occupation. 
occasionally there be mild cyclone in the pit. an old work perhaps a mile away will collapse. a whole gallery sink bodily. then the displace air rush through the inhabit mine and to quote their own expression blow the pitman about like dry leaf. few thing be more amuse than the spectacle of a burly tyneside foreman who fail to dodge round a corner in time be put down by the wind sit fashion on a knobby lump of coal. 
but most impressive of all be a tale they tell of a fire in a pit many year ago. the coal catch light. they have to send earth and brick down the shaft and build great dam across the gallery to choke the fire. imagine the scene a few hundred foot underground with the air grow hot and hot each moment and the carbonic acid gas trickle through the dam. after a time the rough dam gap and the gas pour in afresh and the englishman go down and leeped the crack between roof and dam sill with anything they could get. cooly faint and have to be take away but no one die and behind the first dam they build great masonry one and best that fire. though for a long time afterwards whenever they pump water into it the steam would puff out from crevice in the grind above. 
it be a queer life that they lead these men of the coal field and a big life to boot. to describe one half of their labour would need a week at the least and would be incomplete then. if you want to see anything they say you should go over to the baragunda copper mine. you should look at the barakar ironwork. you should see our bore operation five mile away. you should see how we sink pit. you should above all see giridih bazaar on a sunday. why you haven t see anything. there s no end of a sonthal mission hereabouts. all the little dev dear have go on a picnic. wait till they come back and see em learn to read. 
ala. one cannot wait. at the most one can but thrust an impertinent pen skin deep into matter only properly understand by specialist.
