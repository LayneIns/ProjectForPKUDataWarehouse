boanerges blitzen servant of the queen be a dismal failure be a might have be. in a luckless moment he discover men rise to high position through a ready pen. boanerges blitzen argue therefore i with the selfsame weapon can attain a high. only he do not posse when he make the trial wicked wit of c lv n irony of l l. 
[men who spar with government need to back their blow something more than ordinary journalistic prose. ]. 
never young civilian s prospect be so bright till an indian paper find that he could write. never young civilian s prospect be so dark when the wretched blitzen write to make his mark. certainly he score it bold and black and firm in that indian paper make his senior squirm quote office scandal write the tactless truth be there ever know a more misguide youth. when the rag he write for praise his plucky game boanerges blitzen felt that this be fame. when the men he write of shake their head and swear boanerges blitzen only write the more. 
pose a young ithuriel resolute and grim till he find promotion didn t come to him. till he find that reprimand weekly be his lot and his many district curiously hot. 
till he find his furlough strangely hard to win boanerges blitzen didn t care to pin. then it seem to dawn on him something wasn t right boanerges blitzen put it down to spite. 
languish in a district desolate and dry. watch the local government yearly pas him by. wonder where the hitch be. call it most unfair. * * * * * * * * *. 
that be seven year ago and he still be there. 
municipal. 
why be my district death rate low. say binks of hezabad. well drain and sewage outfall be my own peculiar fad. 
i learn a lesson once it run thus quoth that most veracious man. 
it be an august even and in snowy garment clothe i pay a round of visit in the line of hezabad. when presently my waler saw and do not like at all a commissariat elephant career down the mall. 
i couldn t see the driver and across my mind it rush that that commissariat elephant have suddenly go musth. 
i didn t care to meet him and i couldn t well get down so i let the waler have it and we head for the town. 
the buggy be a new one and praise dyke it stand the strain till the waler jump a bullock just above the city drain. and the next that i remember be a hurricane of squeal and the creature make toothpick of my five foot patent wheel. 
he seem to want the owner so i flee distraught with fear to the main drain sewage outfall while he snort in my ear reach the four foot drain head safely and in darkness and despair felt the brute s proboscis finger my terror stiffen hair. 
hear it trumpet on my shoulder try to crawl a little high find the main drain sewage outfall block some eight foot up with mire. and for twenty reek minute sir my very marrow freeze while the trunk be feel blindly for a purchase on my toe. 
it miss me by a fraction but my hair be turn grey before they call the driver up and drag the brute away. 
then i seek the city elder and my word be very plain. they flush that four foot drain head and it never choke again. 
you may hold with surface drainage and the sun for garbage cure till you ve be a periwinkle shrink coyly up a sewer. 
i believe in well flush culvert. 
this be why the death rate s small. and if you don t believe me get shikarred yourself. that s all. 
a code of moral. 
l you should think this story true i merely mention i evolve it lately. ti a most unmitigated misstatement. 
now jones have leave his new wed bride to keep his house in order and hie away to the hurrum hill above the afghan border to sit on a rock with a heliograph. but ere he leave he teach his wife the work of the code that set the mile at naught. 
and love have make him very sage a nature make her fair. so cupid and apollo link per heliograph the pair. at dawn across the hurrum hill he flash her counsel wise at e en the die sunset bore her husband s homily. 
he warn her gainst seductive youth in scarlet clothe and gold a much a gainst the blandishment paternal of the old. but keep his grave warning for. hereby the ditty hang. that snowy haired lothario lieutenant general bang. 
twas general bang with aide and staff who tittup on the way when they behold a heliograph tempestuously at play. they think of border rising and of station sack and burn so stop to take the message down and this be what they learn. 
dash dot dot dot dot dash dot dash dot twice. the general swear. 
be ever general officer address a dear before. my love i faith. my duck gadzooks. my darling popsy wop. spirit of great lord wolseley who be on that mountaintop. 
the artless aide de camp be mute. the gild staff be still a dumb with pen up mirth they book that message from the hill. for clear a summer lightning flare the husband s warn run. don t dance or ride with general bang a most immoral man. 
[at dawn across the hurrum hill he flash her counsel wise but howsoever love be blind the world at large hath eye. ] with damnatory dot and dash he heliograph his wife some interest detail of the general s private life. 
the artless aide de camp be mute the shin staff be still and red and ever red grow the general s shave gill. 
and this be what he say at last. his feeling matter not. i think we ve tap a private line. hi. three about there. trot. 
all honour unto bang for ne er do jones thereafter know by word or act official who read off that helio. 
but the tale be on the frontier and from michni to mooltan they know the worthy general a that most immoral man. 
the last department. 
twelve hundred million men be spread about this earth and i and you wonder when you and i be dead what will those luckless million do. 
none whole or clean we cry or free from stain of favour. wait awhile till we attain the last department where nor fraud nor fool nor grade nor greed shall trouble u again. 
fear favour or affection what be these to the grim head who claim our service. i never know a wife or interest yet delay that pukka step miscall decease. 
when leave long overdue none can deny. when idleness of all eternity become our furlough and the marigold our thriftless bullion mint treasury. 
transfer to the eternal settlement each in his strait wood scantled office pen no long brown revers smith s appeal or jones record his minute of dissent. 
and one long since a pillar of the court a mud between the beam thereof be work. and one who write on phosphate for the crop be subject matter of his own report. 
these be the glorious end whereto we pas let him who be go call on him who be. and he shall see the mallie steal the slab for currie grinder and for goat the grass. 
a breath of wind a border bullet s flight a draught of water or a horse s fright the drone of the fat sheristadar cease the punkah stop and fall the night. 
for you or me. do those who live decline the step that offer or their work resign. trust me today s most indispensables five hundred men can take your place or mine.

volume ii ballad and barrack room ballad. 
ballad. 
the ballad of east and west. 
oh east be east and west be west and never the twain shall meet till earth and sky stand presently at god s great judgment seat. but there be neither east nor west border nor breed nor birth when two strong men stand face to face tho they come from the end of the earth. 
kamal be out with twenty men to raise the border side and he ha lift the colonel s mare that be the colonel s pride. he ha lift her out of the stable door between the dawn and the day and turn the calkin upon her foot and ride her far away. 
then up and speak the colonel s son that lead a troop of the guide. be there never a man of all my men can say where kamal hide. then up and speak mahommed khan the son of the ressaldar. if ye know the track of the morning mist ye know where his picket be. 
at dusk he harry the abazai at dawn he be into bonair but he must go by fort bukloh to his own place to fare so if ye gallop to fort bukloh a fast a a bird can fly by the favour of god ye may cut him off ere he win to the tongue of jagai. 
but if he be past the tongue of jagai right swiftly turn ye then for the length and the breadth of that grisly plain be sow with kamal s men. there be rock to the leave and rock to the right and low lean thorn between and ye may hear a breech bolt snick where never a man be see. 
the colonel s son ha take a horse and a raw rough dun be he with the mouth of a bell and the heart of hell and the head of the gallows tree. 
the colonel s son to the fort ha win they bid him stay to eat who ride at the tail of a border thief he sit not long at his meat. 
he s up and away from fort bukloh a fast a he can fly till he be aware of his father s mare in the gut of the tongue of jagai till he be aware of his father s mare with kamal upon her back and when he could spy the white of her eye he make the pistol crack. 
he ha fire once he ha fire twice but the whistle ball go wide. ye shoot like a soldier kamal say. show now if ye can ride. 
it s up and over the tongue of jagai a blow dustdevils go the dun he flee like a stag of ten but the mare like a barren doe. 
the dun he lean against the bite and slug his head above but the red mare play with the snaffle bar a a maiden play with a glove. 
there be rock to the leave and rock to the right and low lean thorn between and thrice he hear a breech bolt snick tho never a man be see. 
they have ride the low moon out of the sky their hoof drum up the dawn the dun he go like a wound bull but the mare like a new rouse fawn. 
the dun he fell at a water course in a woful heap fell he and kamal ha turn the red mare back and pull the rider free. 
he ha knock the pistol out of his hand small room be there to strive twas only by favour of mine quoth he ye ride so long alive. there be not a rock for twenty mile there be not a clump of tree but cover a man of my own men with his rifle cock on his knee. 
if i have raise my bridle hand a i have hold it low the little jackal that flee so fast be feast all in a row. if i have bow my head on my breast a i have hold it high the kite that whistle above u now be gorge till she could not fly. lightly answer the colonel s son. do good to bird and beast but count who come for the break meat before thou makest a feast. 
if there should follow a thousand sword to carry my bone away belike the price of a jackal s meal be more than a thief could pay. 
they will fee their horse on the stand crop their men on the garner grain the thatch of the byre will serve their fire when all the cattle be slay. but if thou thinkest the price be fair thy brother wait to sup the hound be kin to the jackal spawn howl dog and call them up. and if thou thinkest the price be high in steer and gear and stack give me my father s mare again and i ll fight my own way back. 
kamal ha grip him by the hand and set him upon his foot. no talk shall be of dog say he when wolf and gray wolf meet. 
may i eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath. what dam of lance bring thee forth to jest at the dawn with death. lightly answer the colonel s son. i hold by the blood of my clan. take up the mare for my father s gift by god she ha carry a man. the red mare run to the colonel s son and nuzzle against his breast. we be two strong men say kamal then but she loveth the young best. 
so she shall go with a lifter s dower my turquoise stud rein my broider saddle and saddle cloth and silver stirrup twain. the colonel s son a pistol draw and hold it muzzle end ye have take the one from a foe say he. will ye take the mate from a friend. a gift for a gift say kamal straight. a limb for the risk of a limb. 
thy father ha send his son to me i ll send my son to him. with that he whistle his only son that drop from a mountain crest he tread the ling like a buck in spring and he look like a lance in rest. 
now here be thy master kamal say who lead a troop of the guide and thou must ride at his leave side a shield on shoulder ride. till death or i cut loose the tie at camp and board and bed thy life be his thy fate it be to guard him with thy head. 
so thou must eat the white queen s meat and all her foe be thine and thou must harry thy father s hold for the peace of the border line and thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power belike they will raise thee to ressaldar when i be hang in peshawur. 
they have look each other between the eye and there they find no fault they have take the oath of the brother in blood on leaven bread and salt. they have take the oath of the brother in blood on fire and fresh cut sod on the hilt and the haft of the khyber knife and the wondrous name of god. 
the colonel s son he ride the mare and kamal s boy the dun and two have come back to fort bukloh where there go forth but one. 
and when they draw to the quarter guard full twenty sword fly clear there be not a man but carry his feud with the blood of the mountaineer. 
ha do. ha do. say the colonel s son. put up the steel at your side. last night ye have strike at a border thief tonight ti a man of the guide. 
oh east be east and west be west and never the twain shall meet till earth and sky stand presently at god s great judgment seat. but there be neither east nor west border nor breed nor birth when two strong men stand face to face tho they come from the end of the earth. 
the last suttee. 
not many year ago a king die in one of the rajpoot state. his wife disregard the order of the english against suttee would have break out of the palace have not the gate be bar. 
but one of them disguise a the king s favourite dance girl pass through the line of guard and reach the pyre. there her courage fail she pray her cousin a baron of the court to kill her. this he do not know who she be. 
udai chand lay sick to death in his hold by gungra hill. all night we hear the death gong ring for the soul of the die rajpoot king all night beat up from the woman s wing a cry that we could not still. 
all night the baron come and go the lord of the out guard. all night the cressets glimmer pale on ulwar sabre and tonk jezail mewar headstall and marwar mail that clink in the palace yard. 
in the golden room on the palace roof all night he fight for air. and there be sob behind the screen rustle and whisper of woman unseen and the hungry eye of the boondi queen on the death she might not share. 
he pass at dawn the death fire leap from ridge to river head from the malwa plain to the abu scar. and wail upon wail go up to the star behind the grim zenana bar when they know that the king be dead. 
the dumb priest kneel to tie his mouth and robe him for the pyre. the boondi queen beneath u cry. see now that we die a our mother die in the bridal bed by our master s side. out woman. to the fire. 
we drive the great gate home apace. white hand be on the sill. but ere the rush of the unseen foot have reach the turn to the open street the bar shoot down the guard drum beat we hold the dovecot still. 
a face look down in the gather day and laugh speak from the wall. ohe they mourn here. let me by azizun the lucknow nautch girl i. when the house be rotten the rat must fly and i seek another thrall. 
for i rule the king a ne er do queen tonight the queen rule me. guard them safely but let me go or ever they pay the debt they owe in scourge and torture. she leap below and the grim guard watch her flee. 
they know that the king have spend his soul on a north breed dance girl. that he pray to a flat nose lucknow god and kiss the grind where her foot have tread and doom to death at her drunken nod and swear by her light curl. 
we bore the king to his father place where the tomb of the sun bear stand. where the gray ape swing and the peacock preen on fret pillar and jewel screen and the wild boar couch in the house of the queen on the drift of the desert sand. 
the herald read his title forth we set the log aglow. friend of the english free from fear baron of luni to jeysulmeer lord of the desert of bikaneer king of the jungle go. 
all night the red flame stab the sky with waver wind toss spear. and out of a shatter temple creep a woman who veil her head and weep and call on the king but the great king sleep and turn not for her tear. 
small think have he to mark the strife cold fear with hot desire when thrice she leap from the leap flame and thrice she beat her breast for shame and thrice like a wound dive she come and moan about the fire. 
one watch a bow shoot from the blaze the silent street between who have stand by the king in sport and fray to blade in ambush or boar at bay and he be a baron old and gray and kin to the boondi queen. 
he say. o shameless put aside the veil upon thy brow. who hold the king and all his land to the wanton will of a harlot s hand. will the white ash rise from the blister brand. stoop down and call him now. 
then she. by the faith of my tarnish soul all thing i do not well i have hop to clear ere the fire die and lay me down by my master s side to rule in heaven his only bride while the others howl in hell. 
but i have felt the fire s breath and hard it be to die. yet if i may pray a rajpoot lord to sully the steel of a thakur s sword with base bear blood of a trade abhor and the thakur answer ay. 
he draw and strike. the straight blade drink the life beneath the breast. 
i have look for the queen to face the flame but the harlot dy for the rajpoot dame sister of mine pas free from shame pas with thy king to rest. 
the black log crash above the white. the little flame and lean red a slaughter and blue a steel that whistle and flutter from head to heel leap up anew for they find their meal on the heart of the boondi queen.

abdhur rahman the durani chief of him be the story tell. his mercy fill the khyber hill his grace be manifold. he ha take toll of the north and the south his glory reacheth far and they tell the tale of his charity from balkh to kandahar.

the ballad of the king s jest. 
when spring time flush the desert grass our kafilas wind through the khyber pas. 
lean be the camel but fat the frail light be the purse but heavy the bale a the snowbound trade of the north come down to the market square of peshawur town. 
in a turquoise twilight crisp and chill a kafila camp at the foot of the hill. 
then blue smoke haze of the cook rise and tent peg answer to hammer nose. and the picket pony shag and wild strain at their rope a the fee be pile. and the bubble camel beside the load sprawl for a furlong adown the road. and the persian pussy cat bring for sale spat at the dog from the camel bale. and the tribesman bellow to hasten the food. and the camp fire twinkle by fort jumrood. and there flee on the wing of the gather dusk a savour of camel and carpet and musk a murmur of voice a reek of smoke to tell u the trade of the khyber wake. 
the lid of the flesh pot chatter high the knife be whet and then come i to mahbub ali the muleteer patch his bridle and count his gear cram with the gossip of half a year. 
but mahbub ali the kindly say good be speech when the belly be feed. so we plunge the hand to the mid wrist deep in a cinnamon stew of the fat tail sheep and he who never hath taste the food by allah. he knoweth not bad from good. 
we cleanse our beard of the mutton grease we lay on the mat and be fill with peace and the talk slide north and the talk slide south with the slide puff from the hookah mouth. 
four thing great than all thing be woman and horse and power and war. 
we spake of them all but the last the most for i seek a word of a russian post of a shifty promise an unsheathe sword and a gray coat guard on the helmund ford. 
then mahbub ali lower his eye in the fashion of one who be weave lie. 
quoth he. of the russian who can say. when the night be gather all be gray. but we look that the gloom of the night shall die in the morning flush of a blood red sky. 
friend of my heart be it meet or wise to warn a king of his enemy. we know what heaven or hell may bring but no man knoweth the mind of the king. 
that unsought counsel be curse of god attesteth the story of wali dad. 
his sire be leaky of tongue and pen his dam be a cluck khuttuck hen. and the colt breed close to the vice of each for he carry the curse of an unstanched speech. 
therewith madness so that he seek the favour of king at the kabul court. and travel in hope of honour far to the line where the gray coat squadron be. 
there have i journey too but i saw naught say naught and do not die. he hark to rumour and snatch at a breath of this one knoweth and that one saith legend that run from mouth to mouth of a gray coat come and sack of the south. 
these have i also hear they pas with each new spring and the winter grass. 
hot foot southward forget of god back to the city run wali dad even to kabul in full durbar the king hold talk with his chief in war. 
into the press of the crowd he break and what he have hear of the come speak. 
then gholam hyder the red chief smile a a mother might on a babble child. but those who would laugh restrain their breath when the face of the king show dark a death. 
evil it be in full durbar to cry to a ruler of gather war. slowly he lead to a peach tree small that grow by a cleave of the city wall. 
and he say to the boy. they shall praise thy zeal so long a the red spurt follow the steel. 
and the rus be upon u even now. great be thy prudence await them thou. watch from the tree. thou art young and strong surely thy vigil be not for long. 
the rus be upon u thy clamour run. surely an hour shall bring their van. wait and watch. when the host be near shout aloud that my men may hear. 
friend of my heart be it meet or wise to warn a king of his enemy. a guard be set that he might not flee a score of bayonet ring the tree. 
the peach bloom fell in shower of snow when he shake at his death a he look below. by the power of god who alone be great till the seventh day he fight with his fate. 
then madness take him and men declare he mow in the branch a ape and bear and last a a sloth ere his body fail and he hang a a bat in the fork and wail and sleep the cord of his hand untie and he fell and be catch on the point and die. 
heart of my heart be it meet or wise to warn a king of his enemy. we know what heaven or hell may bring but no man knoweth the mind of the king. 
of the gray coat come who can say. when the night be gather all be gray. 
to thing great than all thing be the first be love and the second war. 
and since we know not how war may prove heart of my heart let u talk of love.

at the hand of harendra mukerji senior gomashta g. b. t. 
boh da thone be a warrior bold. his sword and his snide be boss with gold. 
and the peacock banner his henchman bore be stiff with bullion but stiff with gore. 
he shoot at the strong and he slash at the weak from the salween scrub to the chindwin teak. 
he crucify noble he sacrifice mean he fill old lady with kerosene. 
while over the water the paper cry the patriot fight for his countryside. 
but little they care for the native press the wear white soldier in khaki dress. 
who tramp through the jungle and camp in the byre who die in the swamp and be tombed in the mire. 
who give up their life at the queen s command for the pride of their race and the peace of the land. 
now first of the foeman of boh da thone be captain o neil of the black tyrone and his be a company seventy strong who hustle that dissolute chief along. 
there be lad from galway and louth and meath who go to their death with a joke in their teeth and worship with fluency fervour and zeal the mud on the boot heel of crook o neil. 
but ever a blight on their labour lay and ever their quarry would vanish away till the sun dry boy of the black tyrone take a brotherly interest in boh da thone. and sooth if pursuit in possession end the boh and his tracker be best of friend. 
the word of a scout a march by night a rush through the mist a scatter fight a volley from cover a corpse in the clear the glimpse of a loin cloth and heavy jade earring the flare of a village the tally of slay and. the boh be abroad on the raid again. 
they curse their luck a the irish will they give him credit for cunning and skill they bury their dead they bolt their beef and start anew on the track of the thief till in place of the kalends of greece men say when crook and his darling come back with the head. 
they have hunt the boh from the hill to the plain he double and break for the hill again. they have cripple his power for rapine and raid they have rout him out of his pet stockade and at last they come when the day star tire to a camp desert a village fire. 
a black cross blister the morning gold and the body upon it be stark and cold. the wind of the dawn go merrily past the high grass bow her plume to the blast. 
and out of the grass on a sudden break a spirtle of fire a whorl of smoke. 
and captain o neil of the black tyrone be bless with a slug in the ulnar bone the gift of his enemy boh da thone. 
now a slug that be hammer from telegraph wire be a thorn in the flesh and a rankle fire. * * * * *. 
the shoot wind fester a shoot wound may in a steam barrack at mandalay. 
the leave arm throb and the captain swear i d like to be after the boh once more. the fever hold him the captain say i d give a hundred to look at his head. 
the hospital punkah creak and whir but babu harendra. gomashta. hear. 
he think of the cane brake green and dank that girdle his home by the dacca tank. he think of his wife and his high school son he think but abandon the think of a gun. his sleep be break by vision dread of a shin boh with a silver head. 
he keep his counsel and go his way and swindle the cartmen of half their pay. 
* * * * *. 
and the month go on a the bad must do and the boh return to the raid anew. 
but the captain have quit the long draw strife and in far simoorie have take a wife. and she be a damsel of delicate mould with hair like the sunshine and heart of gold. 
and little she know the arm that embrace have cleave a man from the brow to the waist. and little she know that the love lip have order a quiver life s eclipse. 
and the eye that light at her light breath have glare unawed in the gate of death. 
for these be matter a man would hide a a general rule from an innocent bride. 
and little the captain think of the past and of all men babu harendra last. 
* * * * *. 
but slow in the sludge of the kathun road the government bullock train tot it load. speckle and spotless and shin with ghee in the rearmost cart sit the babu jee. 
and ever a phantom before him flee of a scowl boh with a silver head. 
then the lead cart stick though the cooly slave and the cartmen flog and the escort rave. and out of the jungle with yell and squeal prance boh da thone and his gang at his heel. 
then belch blunderbuss answer back the snide s snarl and the carbine s crack and the blithe revolver begin to sing to the blade that twang on the lock ring and the brown flesh blue where the bay net kiss a the steel shoot back with a wrench and a twist and the great white bullock with onyx eye watch the soul of the dead arise and over the smoke of the fusillade the peacock banner stagger and sway. 
oh gay of scrimmage man may see be a well work rush on the g. b. t. 
the babu shake at the horrible sight and gird his ponderous loin for flight but fate have ordain that the boh should start on a lone hand raid of the rearmost cart and out of that cart with a bellow of woe the babu fell flat on the top of the boh. 
for year have harendra serve the state to the growth of his purse and the girth of his pet. 
there be twenty stone a the tally man know on the broad of the chest of this best of bohs. and twenty stone from a height discharge be bad for a boh with a spleen enlarge. 
oh short be the struggle severe be the shock he drop like a bullock he lay like a block. and the babu above him convulse with fear hear the labour life breath hiss out in his ear. 
and thus in a fashion undignified the princely pest of the chindwin die. * * * * *. 
turn now to simoorie where lap in his ease the captain be pet the bride on his knee where the whit of the bullet the wound man s scream be mix a the mist of some devilish dream forget forget the sweat of the shamble where the hill daisy bloom and the gray monkey gambol from the sword belt set free and release from the steel the peace of the lord be with captain o neil. * * * * *.

a the rabbit be draw to the rattlesnake s power a the smoker s eye fill at the opium hour a a horse reach up to the manger above a the wait ear yearn for the whisper of love from the arm of the bride iron visaged and slow the captain bend down to the head of the boh. 
and e en a he look on the thing where it lay twixt the wink new spoon and the napkin array the free mind flee back to the long ago day the hand to hand scuffle the smoke and the blaze the force march at night and the quick rush at dawn the banjo at twilight the burial ere morn the stench of the marsh the raw pierce smell when the overhand stab cut silence the yell the oath of his irish that surge when they stand where the black cross hang o er the kuttamow flood. 
a a derelict ship drift away with the tide the captain go out on the past from his bride. 
back back through the spring to the chill of the year when he hunt the boh from maloon to tsaleer. 
a the shape of a corpse dimmer up through deep water in his eye light the passionless passion of slaughter and men who have fight with o neil for the life have gaze on his face with le dread than his wife. 
for she who have hold him so long could not hold him though a four month eternity should have control him but watch the twin terror the head turn to head the scowl scar black and the flush savage red the spirit that change from her know and fly to some grim hide past she have never a clue to. 
but it know a it grin for he touch it unfearing and mutter aloud so you keep that jade earring. 
then nod and kindly a friend nod to friend old man you fight well but you lose in the end.

the lament of the border cattle thief. 
o woe be me for the merry life i lead beyond the bar and a treble woe for my winsome wife that weep at shalimar. 
they have take away my long jezail my shield and sabre fine and heave me into the central jail for lift of the kine. 
the steer may low within the byre the jat may tend his grain but there ll be neither loot nor fire till i come back again. 
and god have mercy on the jat when once my fetter fall and heaven defend the farmer s hut when i be loose from thrall. 
it s woe to bend the stubborn back above the grinching quern it s woe to hear the leg bar clack and jingle when i turn. 
but for the sorrow and the shame the brand on me and mine i ll pay you back in leap flame and loss of the butcher kine. 
for every cow i spar before in charity set free if i may reach my hold once more i ll reive an honest three. 
for every time i raise the low that scar the dusty plain by sword and cord by torch and tow i ll light the land with twain. 
ride hard ride hard to abazai young sahib with the yellow hair lie close lie close a khuttucks lie fat herd below bonair. 
the one i ll shoot at twilight tide at dawn i ll drive the other. the black shall mourn for hoof and hide the white man for his brother. 
ti war red war i ll give you then war till my sinew fail. for the wrong you have do to a chief of men and a thief of the zukka kheyl. 
and if i fall to your hand afresh i give you leave for the sin that you cram my throat with the foul pig s flesh and swing me in the skin. 
the rhyme of the three captain. 
this ballad appear to refer to one of the exploit of the notorious paul jones the american pirate. it be found on fact. 
at the close of a winter day their anchor down by london town the three great captain lay. and one be admiral of the north from solway firth to skye and one be lord of the wessex coast and all the land thereby and one be master of the thames from limehouse to blackwall and he be captain of the fleet the brave of them all. 
their good gun guard their great gray side that be thirty foot in the sheer when there come a certain trade brig with news of a privateer. 
her rig be rough with the clot drift that drive in a northern breeze her side be clog with the lazy weed that spawn in the eastern sea. 
light she ride in the rude tide rip to leave and right she roll and the skipper sit on the scuttle butt and star at an empty hold. 
i ha pay port due for your law quoth he and where be the law ye boast if i sail unscathed from a heathen port to be rob on a christian coast. ye have smoke the hive of the laccadives a we burn the louse in a bunk we tack not now to a gallang prow or a plunge pei ho junk. i have no fear but the sea be clear a far a a sail might fare till i meet with a lime wash yankee brig that ride off finisterre. 
there be canvas blind to his bow gun port to screen the weight he bore and the signal run for a merchantman from sandy hook to the nore. 
he would not fly the rover flag the bloody or the black but now he float the gridiron and now he flaunt the jack. he speak of the law a he crimp my crew he swear it be only a loan. but when i would ask for my own again he swear it be none of my own. 
he ha take my little parrakeet that nest beneath the line he ha strip my rail of the shaddock frail and the green unripened pine. he ha take my bale of dammer and spice i win beyond the sea he ha take my grin heathen god and what should he want o these. my foremast would not mend his boom my deckhouse patch his boat. he ha whittle the two this yank yahoo to peddle for shoe peg oat. 
i could not fight for the fail light and a rough beam sea beside but i hull him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lie. 
have i have gun. a i have good. to work my christian harm i have run him up from his quarter deck to trade with his own yard arm. i have nail his ear to my capstan head and rip them off with a saw and souse them in the bilgewater and serve them to him raw. i have fling him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rock dark i have tow him aft of his own craft a bait for his brother shark. i have lap him round with cocoa husk and drench him with the oil and lash him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil. i have strip his hide for my hammock side and tasselled his beard i the mesh and spit his crew on the live bamboo that grow through the gangrene flesh. i have heave him down by the mangrove brown where the mud reef suck and draw moor by the heel to his own keel to wait for the land crab s claw. he be lazar within and lime without ye can nose him far enow for he carry the taint of a musky ship the reek of the slaver s dhow. the skipper look at the tiering gun and the bulwark tall and cold and the captain three full courteously peer down at the gutted hold and the captain three call courteously from deck to scuttle butt. good sir we ha deal with that merchantman or ever your teeth be cut. 
your word be word of a lawless race and the law it standeth thus. he come of a race that have never a law and he never ha board u. 
we ha sell him canvas and rope and spar we know that his price be fair and we know that he weep for the lack of a law a he ride off finisterre. 
and since he be damn for a gallows thief by you and good than you we hold it meet that the english fleet should know that we hold him true. the skipper call to the tall taffrail. and what be that to me. do ever you hear of a yankee brig that rifle a seventy three. do i loom so large from your quarter deck that i lift like a ship o the line. he ha learn to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft a mine. 
there be never a law on the coco key to hold a white man in but we do not steal the nigger meal for that be a nigger s sin. 
must he have his law a a quid to chaw or lay in brass on his wheel. doe he steal with tear when he buccaneer. fore gad then why doe he steal. the skipper bite on a deep sea word and the word it be not sweet for he could see the captain three have signal to the fleet. 
but three and two in white and blue the whimper flag begin. we have hear a tale of a foreign sail but he be a merchantman. the skipper peer beneath his palm and swear by the great horn spoon. fore gad the chaplain of the fleet would bless my picaroon. by two and three the flag blow free to lash the laugh air. we have sell our spar to the merchantman we know that his price be fair. the skipper wink his western eye and swear by a china storm. they ha rig him a joseph s jury coat to keep his honour warm. the halliard twang against the top the bunt belly broad the skipper spat in the empty hold and mourn for a waste cord. 
masthead masthead the signal speed by the line o the british craft. the skipper call to his lascar crew and put her about and laugh. it s mainsail haul my bully boy all we ll out to the sea again ere they set u to paint their pirate saint or scrub at his grapnel chain. 
it s fore sheet free with her head to the sea and the swing of the unbought brine we ll make no sport in an english court till we come a a ship o the line. till we come a a ship o the line my lad of thirty foot in the sheer lift again from the out main with news of a privateer. fly his pluck at our mizzen truck for weft of admiralty heave his head for our dipsey lead in sign that we keep the sea. 
then fore sheet home a she lift to the foam we stand on the outward tack we be pay in the coin of the white man s trade the bezant be hard ay and black. 
the frigate bird shall carry my word to the kling and the orang laut how a man may sail from a heathen coast to be rob in a christian port. how a man may be rob in christian port while three great captain there shall dip their flag to a slaver s rag to show that his trade be fair. 
the ballad of the clampherdown. 
it be our war ship clampherdown would sweep the channel clean wherefore she keep her hatch close when the merry channel chop arise to save the bleach marine. 
she have one bow gun of a hundred ton and a great stern gun beside. they dip their nose deep in the sea they rack their stay and stanchion free in the wash of the wind whip tide. 
it be our war ship clampherdown fell in with a cruiser light that carry the dainty hotchkiss gun and a pair o heel wherewith to run from the grip of a close fight fight. 
she open fire at seven mile a ye shoot at a bob cork and once she fire and twice she fire till the bow gun droop like a lily tire that loll upon the stalk. 
captain the bow gun melt apace the deck beam break below twere well to rest for an hour or twain and patch the shatter plate again. and he answer make it so. 
she open fire within the mile a ye shoot at the fly duck and the great stern gun shoot fair and true with the heave of the ship to the stainless blue and the great stern turret stick. 
captain the turret fill with steam the fee pipe burst below you can hear the hiss of the helpless ram you can hear the twist runner jam. and he answer turn and go. 
it be our war ship clampherdown and grimly do she roll. swing round to take the cruiser s fire a the white whale face the thresher s ire when they war by the freeze pole. 
captain the shell be fall fast and fast still fall we. and it be not meet for english stock to bide in the heart of an eight day clock the death they cannot see. 
lie down lie down my bold a. b. we drift upon her beam. we dare not ram for she can run. and dare ye fire another gun and die in the peel steam. 
it be our war ship clampherdown that carry an armour belt. but fifty foot at stern and bow lay bare a the paunch of the purser s sow to the hail of the nordenfeldt. 
captain they hack u through and through. the chill steel bolt be swift. we have empty the bunker in open sea their shrapnel burst where our coal should be. and he answer let her drift. 
it be our war ship clampherdown swing round upon the tide her two dumb gun glare south and north and the blood and the bubble steam run forth and she grind the cruiser s side. 
captain they cry the fight be do they bid you send your sword. and he answer grapple her stern and bow. they have ask for the steel. they shall have it now. out cutlass and board. 
it be our war ship clampherdown spew up four hundred men. and the scald stoker yelp delight a they roll in the waist and hear the fight stamp o er their steel wall pen. 
they clear the cruiser end to end from con tower to hold. they fight a they fight in nelson s fleet. they be strip to the waist they be bare to the foot a it be in the day of old. 
it be the sink clampherdown heave up her batter side and carry a million pound in steel to the cod and the corpse feed conger eel and the scour of the channel tide. 
it be the crew of the clampherdown stand out to sweep the sea on a cruiser win from an ancient foe a it be in the day of long ago and a it still shall be. 
the ballad of the bolivar. 
seven men from all the world back to dock again roll down the ratcliffe road drink and raise cain. give the girl another drink fore we sign away we that take the bolivar out across the bay.

this i have read in a book he say and that be tell to me and this i have think that another man think of a prince in muscovy. the good soul flock like home dove and bid him clear the path and peter twirl the jangle key in weariness and wrath. 
ye have read ye have hear ye have think he say and the tale be yet to run. by the worth of the body that once ye have give answer what ha ye do. then tomlinson look back and forth and little good it bore for the darkness stay at his shoulder blade and heaven s gate before. o this i have felt and this i have guess and this i have hear men say and this they write that another man write of a carl in norroway. ye have read ye have felt ye have guess good lack. ye have hamper heaven s gate. there s little room between the star in idleness to prate. o none may reach by hire speech of neighbour priest and kin through borrow deed to god s good meed that lie so fair within. get hence get hence to the lord of wrong for doom ha yet to run and. the faith that ye share with berkeley square uphold you tomlinson.

the spirit grip him by the hair and sun by sun they fell till they come to the belt of naughty star that rim the mouth of hell. the first be red with pride and wrath the next be white with pain but the third be black with clinker sin that cannot burn again. they may hold their path they may leave their path with never a soul to mark they may burn or freeze but they must not cease in the scorn of the out dark. 
the wind that blow between the world it nip him to the bone and he yearn to the flare of hell gate there a the light of his own hearth stone. 
the devil he sit behind the bar where the desperate legion draw but he catch the hasting tomlinson and would not let him through. 
wot ye the price of good pit coal that i must pay. say he that ye rank yoursel so fit for hell and ask no leave of me. i be all o er sib to adam s breed that ye should give me scorn for i strive with god for your first father the day that he be bear. 
sit down sit down upon the slag and answer loud and high the harm that ye do to the son of men or ever you come to die. and tomlinson look up and up and saw against the night the belly of a torture star blood red in hell mouth light. and tomlinson look down and down and saw beneath his foot the frontlet of a torture star milk white in hell mouth heat. 
o i have a love on earth say he that kiss me to my fall and if ye would call my love to me i know she would answer all. all that ye do in love forbid it shall be write fair but now ye wait at hell mouth gate and not in berkeley square. though we whistle your love from her bed tonight i trow she would not run for the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one. the wind that blow between the world it cut him like a knife and tomlinson take up the tale and speak of his sin in life. once i ha laugh at the power of love and twice at the grip of the grave and thrice i ha pat my god on the head that men might call me brave. the devil he blow on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool. do ye think i would waste my good pit coal on the hide of a brain sick fool. i see no worth in the hobnail mirth or the jolthead jest ye do that i should waken my gentleman that be sleep three on a grid. then tomlinson look back and forth and there be little grace for hell gate fill the houseless soul with the fear of naked space. 
nay this i ha hear quo tomlinson and this be noise abroad and this i ha get from a belgian book on the word of a dead french lord. ye ha hear ye ha read ye ha get good lack. and the tale begin afresh have ye sin one sin for the pride o the eye or the sinful lust of the flesh. then tomlinson he grip the bar and yammer let me in for i mind that i borrow my neighbour s wife to sin the deadly sin. the devil he grin behind the bar and bank the fire high. do ye read of that sin in a book. say he. and tomlinson say ay. the devil he blow upon his nail and the little devil run and he say. go husk this whimper thief that come in the guise of a man. winnow him out twixt star and star and sieve his proper worth. there s sore decline in adam s line if this be spawn of earth. 
empusa s crew so naked new they may not face the fire but weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire over the coal they chase the soul and rack it all abroad a child rifle a caddis case or the raven s foolish hoard. 
and back they come with the tattered thing a child after play and they say. the soul that he get from god he ha barter clean away. 
we have thresh a stook of print and book and winnow a chatter wind and many a soul wherefrom he steal but his we cannot find. we have handle him we have dandle him we have sear him to the bone and sure if tooth and nail show truth he ha no soul of his own. the devil he bow his head on his breast and rumble deep and low. i m all o er sib to adam s breed that i should bid him go. 
yet close we lie and deep we lie and if i give him place my gentleman that be so proud would flout me to my face. they d call my house a common stew and me a careless host and i would not anger my gentleman for the sake of a shiftless ghost. the devil he look at the mangle soul that pray to feel the flame and he think of holy charity but he think of his own good name. now ye could haste my coal to waste and sit ye down to fry. do ye think of that theft for yourself. say he. and tomlinson say ay. the devil he blow an outward breath for his heart be free from care. ye have scarce the soul of a louse he say but the root of sin be there and for that sin should ye come in be i the lord alone. but sinful pride ha rule inside and mighty than my own. 
honour and wit fore damn they sit to each his priest and whore. nay scarce i dare myself go there and you they d torture sore. 
ye be neither spirit nor spirk he say. ye be neither book nor brute go get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of man s repute. 
i m all o er sib to adam s breed that i should mock your pain but look that ye win to worthy sin ere ye come back again. get hence the hearse be at your door the grim black stallion wait they bear your clay to place today. speed l ye come too late. go back to earth with a lip unseal go back with an open eye and carry my word to the son of men or ever ye come to die. that the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one and. the god that you take from a print book be with you tomlinson.

down in the infantry nobody care. down in the cavalry colonel e swear. but down in the lead with the wheel at the flog turn the bold bombardier to a little whip dog. 
they be movin into action they be need very sore to learn a little schoolin to a native army corp they ad nip against an uphill they be tuckin down the brow when a tricky trundlin roundshot give the knock to snarleyow. 
they cut im loose an leave im e be almost tear in two but he try to follow after a a well train orse should do. e go an foul the limber an the driver s brother squeal. pull up pull up for snarleyow be head s between be eel. 
the driver umped be shoulder for the wheel be goin round an there ain t no stop conductor. when a batt ry s changin grind. sez e. i break the beggar in an very sad i feel but i couldn t pull up not for you your ead between your eel. 
e adn t ardly speak the word before a droppin shell a little right the batt ry an between the section fell. an when the smoke ad clear away before the limber wheel there lay the driver s brother with be ead between be eel. 
then sez the driver s brother an be word be very plain for gawd s own sake get over me an put me out o pain. they saw be wound be mortial an they judge that it be best so they take an drive the limber straight across be back an chest. 
the driver e give nothin cept a little coughin grunt but e swing be or andsome when it come to action front. an if one wheel be juicy you may lay your monday head twas juicy for the nigger when the case begin to spread.
