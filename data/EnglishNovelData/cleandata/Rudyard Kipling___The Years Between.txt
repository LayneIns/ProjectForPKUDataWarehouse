the declaration of london. 
june. 
on the re assemble of parliament after the coronation the government have no intention of allow their follower to vote accord to their conviction on the declaration of london but insist on a strictly party vote daily paper. 
we be all one heart and one race when the abbey trumpet blow. for a moment s breathe space we have forget you now you return to your honour place pant to shame u anew. 
we have walk with the age dead with our past alive and ablaze and you bid u pawn our honour for bread. this day of all the day. and you cannot wait till our guest be speed or last week s wreath decay. 
the light be still in our eye of faith and gentlehood of service and sacrifice and it doe not match our mood to turn so soon to your treachery that starve our land of her food. 
our ear still carry the sound of our once imperial sea exultant after our king be crown beneath the sun and the breeze. it be too early to have them bind or sell at your decree. 
wait till the memory go wait till the vision fade we may betray in time god know but we would not have it say when you make report to our scornful foe that we kiss a we betray. 
ulster. 

their web shall not become garment neither shall they cover themselves with their work. their work be work of iniquity and the act of violence be in their hand. isaiah lix. 
the dark eleventh hour draw on and see u sell to every evil power we fight against of old. rebellion rapine hate oppression wrong and greed be loose to rule our fate by england s act and deed.

the blood our father spill our love our toil our pain be count u for guilt and only bind our chain. before an empire s eye the traitor claim his price. what need of further lie. we be the sacrifice. 
we ask no more than leave to reap where we have sow through good and ill to cleave to our own flag and throne. now england s shoot and steel beneath that flag must show how loyal heart should kneel to england s old foe. 
we know the war prepare on every peaceful home we know the hell declare for such a serve not rome the terror threat and dread in market hearth and field we know when all be say we perish if we yield. 
believe we dare not boast believe we do not fear we stand to pay the cost in all that men hold dear. what answer from the north. one law one land one throne. if england drive u forth we shall not fall alone. 
the covenant. 

we think we rank above the chance of ill. others might fall not we for we be wise merchant in freedom. so of our free will we let our servant drug our strength with lie. the pleasure and the poison have it way on u a on the mean till we learn that he who lie will steal who steal will slay. neither god s judgment nor man s heart be turn. 
yet there remain his mercy to be seek through wrath and peril till we cleanse the wrong by that last right which our forefather claim when their law fail them and it steward be buy. this be our cause. god help u and make strong our will to meet him late unashamed.

the outlaw. 

through learn and laborious year they set themselves to find fresh terror and undreamed of fear to heap upon mankind. 
all that they draw from heaven above or digged from earth beneath they lay into their treasure trove and arsenal of death. 
while for well weigh advantage sake ruler and rule alike build up the faith they mean to break when the fit hour should strike. 
they trade with the careless earth and good return it give. they plot by their neighbour s hearth the mean to make him slave. 
when all be ready to their hand they loose their hide sword and utterly lay waste a land their oath be pledge to guard. 
coldly they go about to raise to life and make more dread abomination of old day that men believe be dead. 
they pay the price to reach their goal across a world in flame. but their own hate slew their own soul before that victory come. 
zion. 
the doorkeeper of zion they do not always stand in helmet and whole armour with halberd in their hand but be sure of zion and all her mystery they rest awhile in zion sit down and smile in zion. ay even jest in zion. in zion at their ease. 
the gatekeeper of baal they dare not sit or lean but fume and fret and posture and foam and curse between. for be bind to baal whose sacrifice be vain. their rest be scant with baal they glare and pant for baal they mouth and rant for baal for baal in their pain. 
but we will go to zion by choice and not through dread with these our present comrade and those our present dead. and be free of zion in both her fellowship sit down and sup in zion stand up and drink in zion whatever cup in zion be offer to our lip. 
lord robert. 

he pass in the very battle smoke of the war that he have descry. three hundred mile of cannon speak when the master gunner die. 
he pass to the very sound of the gun. but before his eye grow dim he have see the face of the son whose sire have serve with him. 
he have touch their sword hilt and greet each with the old sure word of praise. and there be virtue in touch and speech a it have be in old day. 
so he dismiss them and take his rest and the steadfast spirit go forth between the adore east and west and the tireless gun of the north. 
clean simple valiant well beloved flawless in faith and fame whom neither ease nor honour move an hair s breadth from his aim. 
never again the war wise face the weigh and urgent word that plead in the market place plead and be not hear. 
yet from his life a new life spring through all the host to come and glory be the least of thing that follow this man home. 
the question. 

brother how shall it fare with me when the war be lay aside if it be prove that i be he for whom a world ha die. 
if it be prove that all my good and the great good i will make be purchase me by a multitude who suffer for my sake. 
that i be deliver by mere mankind vow to one sacrifice and not a i hold them battle blind but die with open eye. 
that they do not ask me to draw the sword when they stand to endure their lot that they only look to me for a word and i answer i know them not. 
if it be find when the battle clear their death ha set me free then how shall i live with myself through the year which they have buy for me. 
brother how must it fare with me or how be i justify if it be prove that i be he for whom mankind ha die if it be prove that i be he who be question deny. 
the choice. 

the american spirit speak. 
to the judge of right and wrong with whom fulfilment lie our purpose and our power belong our faith and sacrifice. 
let freedom s land rejoice. our ancient bond be rive. once more to u the eternal choice of good or ill be give. 
not at a little cost hardly by prayer or tear shall we recover the road we lose in the drug and doubt year. 
but after the fire and the wrath but after search and pain his mercy open u a path to live with ourselves again. 
in the gate of death rejoice. we see and hold the good bear witness earth we have make our choice with freedom s brotherhood. 
then praise the lord most high whose strength hath save u whole who bid u choose that the flesh should die and not the live soul. 
to the god in man display where e er we see that birth be love and understand pay a never yet on earth. 
to the spirit that move in man on whom all world depend be glory since our world begin and service to the end.

en dor. 
behold there be a woman that hath a familiar spirit at en dor. 
samuel xxviii. 
the road to en dor be easy to tread for mother or yearn wife. there it be sure we shall meet our dead a they be even in life. earth ha not dream of the bless in store for desolate heart on the road to en dor. 
whisper shall comfort u out of the dark hand ah god. that we know. vision and voice look and heark. shall prove that our tale be true and that those who have pass to the further shore may be hail at a price on the road to en dor. 
but they be so deep in their new eclipse nothing they say can reach unless it be utter by alien lip and frame in a strange s speech. the son must send word to the mother that bore through an hireling s mouth. ti the rule of en dor. 
and not for nothing these gift be show by such a delight our dead. they must twitch and stiffen and slaver a groan ere the eye be set in the head and the voice from the belly begin. therefore we pay them a wage where they ply at en dor. 
even so we have need of faith and patience to follow the clue. often at first what the dear one saith be babble or jest or untrue. lie spirit perplex u sore till our love and our life be well know at en dor. 
oh the road to en dor be the old road and the crazy road of all. straight it run to the witch s abide a it do in the day of saul and nothing ha change of the sorrow in store for such a go down on the road to en dor. 
a recantation. 
to lyde of the music hall. 
what boot it on the god to call. since answer or unheard we perish with the god and all thing make except the word. 
ere certain fate have touch a heart by fifty year make cold i judge thee lyde and thy art o erblown and over bold. 
but he but he of whom bereft i suffer vacant day he on his shield not meanly leave he cherish all thy lay. 
witness the magic coffer stock with convolute rune wherein thy very voice be lock and link to circle tune. 
witness thy portrait smoke defile that deck his shelter place. life seem more present write the child beneath thy well know face. 
and when the grudge day restore him for a breath to home he with fresh crowd of youth adore thee make mirth in rome. 
therefore i humble join the host loyal and loud who bow to thee a queen of song and ghost for i remember how never more rampant rise the hall at thy audacious line than when the news come in from gaul thy son have follow mine. 
but thou didst hide it in thy breast and caper take the brunt of blaze and blare and launch the jest that sweep next week the front. 
singer to child. ours possess sleep before noon but thee wakeful each midnight for the rest no holocaust shall free. 
yet they who use the word assign to hearten and make whole not le than god have serve mankind though vulture rend their soul. 
my boy jack. 
have you news of my boy jack. not this tide. when d you think that he ll come back. not with this wind blow and this tide. 
ha any one else have word of him. not this tide. for what be sink will hardly swim not with this wind blow and this tide. 
oh dear what comfort can i find. none this tide nor any tide except he do not shame his kind not even with that wind blow and that tide. 
then hold your head up all the more this tide and every tide. because he be the son you bore and give to that wind blow and that tide. 
the verdict. 
jutland. 
not in the thick of the fight not in the press of the odds do the hero come to their height or we know the demi god. 
that stand over till peace. we can only perceive men return from the sea very grateful for leave. 
they grant u sudden day snatch from their business of war. but we be too close to appraise what manner of men they be. 
and whether their name go down with age keep victory or whether they battle and drown unreckoned be hide from our eye. 
they be too near to be great but our child shall understand when and how our fate be change and by whose hand. 
our child shall measure their worth. we be content to be blind but we know that we walk on a new bear earth with the saviour of mankind. 
mesopotamia. 

they shall not return to u the resolute the young the eager and whole hearted whom we give. but the men who leave them thriftily to die in their own dung shall they come with year and honour to the grave. 
they shall not return to u the strong men coldly slay in sight of help deny from day to day. but the men who edge their agony and chide them in their pain be they too strong and wise to put away. 
our dead shall not return to u while day and night divide never while the bar of sunset hold. but the idle mind overlings who quibble while they die shall they thrust for high employment a of old. 
shall we only threaten and be angry for an hour. when the storm be end shall we find how softly but how swiftly they have sidle back to power by the favour and contrivance of their kind. 
even while they soothe u while they promise large amend even while they make a show of fear do they call upon their debtor and take council with their friend to confirm and re establish each career. 
their life cannot repay u their death could not undo the shame that they have lay upon our race. but the slothfulness that waste and the arrogance that slew shall we leave it unabated in it place. 
the hy√¶nas. 
after the burial party leave and the baffle kite have flee the wise hy√¶nas come out at eve to take account of our dead. 
how he die and why he die trouble them not a whit. they snout the bush and stone aside and dig till they come to it. 
they be only resolute they shall eat that they and their mate may thrive and they know that the dead be safe meat than the weak thing alive. 
for a goat may butt and a worm may sting and a child will sometimes stand. but a poor dead soldier of the king can never lift a hand. 
they whoop and halloo and scatter the dirt until their tush white take good hold in the army shirt and tug the corpse to light. 
and the pitiful face be shew again for an instant ere they close. but it be not discover to live men only to god and to those. 
who be soulless be free from shame whatever meat they may find. nor do they defile the dead man s name that be reserve for his kind. 
the spy march. 
before the war. 
the outbreak be in full swing and our death rate would sicken napoleon. dr m die last week and c on monday but some more medicine be come. we don t seem to be able to check it at all. village panic badly. in some place not a live soul. but at any rate the experience gain may come in useful so i be keep my note write up to date in case of accident. death be a queer chap to live with for steady company. extract from a private letter from manchuria. 
there be no leader to lead u to honour and yet without leader we sally each man report for duty alone out of sight out of reach of his fellow. there be no bugle to call the battalion and yet without bugle we rally from the end of the earth to the end of the earth to follow the standard of yellow. fall in. o fall in. o fall in. 
not where the squadron mass not where the bayonet shine not where the big shell shout a they pas over the fire line. not where the wound be not where the nation die kill in the cleanly game of war that be no place for a spy. o prince throne and power your work be le than ours here be no place for a spy. 
train to another use we march with colour furl only concern when death break loose on a front of half a world. only for general death the yellow flag may fly while we take post beneath that be the place for a spy. where plague ha spread his pinion over nation and dominion then will be work for a spy. 
the drop shot begin the single funeral pas our skirmisher run in the corps dot the grass. the howl town stampede the taint hamlet die. now it be war indeed now there be room for a spy. o people king and land we be wait your command what be the work for a spy. drum. fear be upon u spy.

the son of martha. 
the son of mary seldom bother for they have inherit that good part but the son of martha favour their mother of the careful soul and the trouble heart. and because she lose her temper once and because she be rude to the lord her guest her son must wait upon mary s son world without end reprieve or rest. 
it be their care in all the age to take the buffet and cushion the shock. it be their care that the gear engage. it be their care that the switch lock. it be their care that the wheel run truly. it be their care to embark and entrain tally transport and deliver duly the son of mary by land and main. 
they say to mountain be ye remov√®d. they say to the less flood be dry. under their rod be the rock reprov√®d they be not afraid of that which be high. then do the hill top shake to the summit then be the bed of the deep lay bare that the son of mary may overcome it pleasantly sleep and unaware. 
they finger death at their glove end where they piece and repiece the live wire. he rear against the gate they rend. they fee him hungry behind their fire. early at dawn ere men see clear they stumble into his terrible stall and hale him forth like a halter steer and goad and turn him till evenfall. 
to these from birth be belief forbid. from these till death be relief afar. they be concern with matter hide under the earth line their altar be. the secret fountain to follow up water withdraw to restore to the mouth and gather the flood a in a cup and pour them again at a city s drouth. 
they do not preach that their god will rouse them a little before the nut work loose. they do not teach that his pity allow them to leave their work when they damn well choose. a in the throng and the light way so in the dark and the desert they stand wary and watchful all their day that their brother s day may be long in the land. 
raise ye the stone or cleave the wood to make a path more fair or flat lo it be black already with blood some son of martha spill for that. not a a ladder from earth to heaven not a a witness to any creed but simple service simply give to his own kind in their common need. 
and the son of mary smile and be bless√®d they know the angel be on their side. they know in them be the grace confess√®d and for them be the mercy multiply. they sit at the foot they hear the word they see how truly the promise run. they have cast their burden upon the lord and the lord he lay it on martha s son. 
mary s son. 
if you stop to find out what your wage will be and how they will clothe and fee you willie my son don t you go on the sea for the sea will never need you. 
if you ask for the reason of every command and argue with people about you willie my son don t you go on the land for the land will do good without you. 
if you stop to consider the work you have do and to boast what your labour be worth dear angel may come for you willie my son but you ll never be want on earth dear.

the dead king. 
edward vii. 

who in the realm to day lay down dear life for the sake of a land more dear. and unconcerned for his own estate toil till the last grudge sand have run. let him approach. it be prove here our king ask nothing of any man more than our king himself ha do. 
for to him above all be life good above all he command her abundance full hand. the peculiar treasure of king be his for the take. all that men come to in dream he inherit wake. 
his marvel of world gather army one heart and all race his sea neath his keel when his war castle foam to their place. the thunder foreshore that answer his herald land. the huge light city adore the assembly upstanding. the council of king call in haste to learn how he be mind the kingdom the power and the glory he deal with unblinded. 
to him come all captain of men all achiever of glory hot from the press of their battle they tell him their story. they reveal him their life in an hour and salute depart joyful to labour afresh he have make them new hearted. and since he weigh men from his youth and no lie long deceive him he speak and exact the truth and the base believe him. 
and god pour him an exquisite wine that be daily renew to him in the clear well love of his people that daily accrue to him. honour and service we give him rejoicingly fearless. faith absolute trust beyond speech and a friendship a peerless. and since he be master and servant in all that we ask him we lean hard on his wisdom in all thing know not how we task him. 
for on him each new day lay command every tyrannous hour to confront or confirm or make smooth some dread issue of power. to deliver true judgment aright at the instant unaided in the strict level ultimate phrase that allow or dissuade. to foresee to allay to avert from u peril unnumbered to stand guard on our gate when he guess that the watchman have slumber. to win time to turn hate to woo folly to service and mightily school his strength to the use of his nation to rule a not rule. these be the work of our king. earth s peace be the proof of them. god give him great work to fulfil and to u the behoof of them. we accept his toil a our right none spar none excuse him. when he be bow by his burden his rest be refuse him. we trouble his age with our weakness the black our shame to u. hear his people have need of him straightway he come to u. 
a he receive so he give nothing grudge naught deny not even the last gasp of his breath when he strive for u die for our sake without question he put from him all that he cherish. simply a any that serve him he serve and he perish. all that king covet be his and he fling it aside for u. simply a any that die in his service he die for u. 
who in the realm to day ha choice of the easy road or the hard to tread. and much concern for his own estate would sell his soul to remain in the sun. let him depart nor look on our dead. our king ask nothing of any man more than our king himself ha do.

a pilgrim s way. 
i do not look for holy saint to guide me on my way or male and female devilkins to lead my foot astray. if these be add i rejoice if not i shall not mind so long a i have leave and choice to meet my fellow kind. for a we come and a we go. and deadly soon go we. the people lord thy people be good enough for me. 
thus i will honour pious men whose virtue shine so bright. though none be more amaze than i when i by chance do right. and i will pity foolish men for woe their sin have breed. though ninety nine per cent. of mine i bring on my own head. and amorite or eremite or general averagee the people lord thy people be good enough for me. 
and when they bore me overmuch i will not shake mine ear recall many thousand such whom i have bore to tear. and when they labour to impress i will not doubt nor scoff. since i myself have do no le and sometimes pull it off. yea a we be and we be not and we pretend to be the people lord thy people be good enough for me. 
and when they work me random wrong a often time hath be i will not cherish hate too long. my hand be none too clean. and when they do me random good i will not feign surprise no more than those whom i have cheer with wayside charity. but a we give and a we take whate er our taking be the people lord thy people be good enough for me. 
but when i meet with frantic folk who sinfully declare there be no pardon for their sin the same i will not spare till i have prove that heaven and hell which in our heart we have show nothing irredeemable on either side the grave. for a we live and a we die if utter death there be the people lord thy people be good enough for me. 
deliver me from every pride the middle high and low that bar me from a brother s side whatever pride he show. and purge me from all heresy of think and speech and pen that bid me judge him otherwise than i be judge. amen. that i may sing of crowd or king or road bear company that i may labour in my day vocation and degree to prove the same in deed and name and hold unshakenly. where er i go whate er i know whoe er my neighbour be. this single faith in life and death and all eternity the people lord thy people be good enough for me.

the female of the specie. 

when the himalayan peasant meet the he bear in his pride he shout to scare the monster who will often turn aside. but the she bear thus accost rend the peasant tooth and nail for the female of the specie be more deadly than the male. 
when nag the bask cobra hear the careless foot of man he will sometimes wriggle sideways and avoid it a he can. but his mate make no such motion where she camp beside the trail. for the female of the specie be more deadly than the male. 
when the early jesuit father preach to huron and choctaw they pray to be deliver from the vengeance of the squaw. twas the woman not the warrior turn those stark enthusiast pale for the female of the specie be more deadly than the male. 
man s timid heart be burst with the thing he must not say for the woman that god give him isn t his to give away. but when hunter meet with husband each confirm the other s tale the female of the specie be more deadly than the male. 
man a bear in most relation worm and savage otherwise man propound negotiation man accept the compromise. very rarely will he squarely push the logic of a fact to it ultimate conclusion in unmitigated act. 
fear or foolishness impel him ere he lay the wicked low to concede some form of trial even to his fierce foe. mirth obscene divert his anger. doubt and pity oft perplex him in deal with an issue to the scandal of the sex. 
but the woman that god give him every fibre of her frame prof her launch for one sole issue arm and engined for the same. and to serve that single issue l the generation fail the female of the specie must be deadly than the male. 
she who face death by torture for each life beneath her breast may not deal in doubt or pity must not swerve for fact or jest. these be purely male diversion not in these her honour dwell. she the other law we live by be that law and nothing else. 
she can bring no more to live than the power that make her great a the mother of the infant and the mistress of the mate. and when babe and man be lack and she stride unclaimed to claim her right a femme. and baron. her equipment be the same. 
she be wed to conviction in default of gross tie. her contention be her child heaven help him who deny. he will meet no suave discussion but the instant white hot wild waken female of the specie war a for spouse and child. 
unprovoked and awful charge even so the she bear fight speech that drip corrode and poison even so the cobra bite scientific vivisection of one nerve till it be raw and the victim writhe in anguish like the jesuit with the squaw. 
so it come that man the coward when he gather to confer with his fellow brave in council dare not leave a place for her where at war with life and conscience he uplift his err hand to some god of abstract justice which no woman understand. 
and man know it. know moreover that the woman that god give him must command but may not govern shall enthral but not enslave him. and she know because she warn him and her instinct never fail that the female of her specie be more deadly than the male.

when the wine stir in their heart their bosom dilate they rise to suppose themselves king over all thing create to decree a new earth at a birth without labour or sorrow to declare. we prepare it to day and inherit to morrow. they choose themselves prophet and priest of minute understand men swift to see do and outrun their extreme command of the tribe which describe with a jibe the perversion of justice pander avow to the crowd whatsoever it lust be. 
swiftly these pull down the wall that their father have make them the impregnable rampart of old they raze and relaid them a playground of pleasure and leisure with limitless entry and haven of rest for the wastrel where once walk the sentry. and because there be need of more pay for the shouter and marcher they disband in face of their foeman their bowman and archer. they reply to their well wishers fear to their enemy laughter say. peace. we have fashion a god which shall save u hereafter. we ascribe all dominion to man in his faction confer and have give to number the name of the wisdom unerring. they say. who ha hate in his soul. who ha envy his neighbour. let him arise and control both that man and his labour. they say. who be eat by sloth. whose unthrift ha destroy him. he shall levy a tribute from all because none have employ him. they say. who hath toil. who hath strive and gather possession. let him be spoil. he hath give full proof of transgression. they say. who be irk by the law. though we may not remove it if he lend u his aid in this raid we will set him above it. so the robber do judgment again upon such a displease him the slayer too boast his slay and the judge release him. 
a for their kinsman far off on the skirt of the nation they harry all earth to make sure none escape reprobation they awaken unrest for a jest in their newly win border and jeer at the blood of their brother betray by their order. they instruct the rule to rebel their ruler to aid them. and since such a obey them not fell their viceroy obey them. when the riotous set them at naught they say. praise the upheaval. for the show and the word and the think of dominion be evil. 
they unwind and fling from them with rage a a rag that defile them the imperial gain of the age which their forefather pile them. they run pant in haste to lay waste and embitter for ever the wellspring of wisdom and strength which be faith and endeavour. they nose out and digged up and drag forth and expose to derision all doctrine of purpose and worth and restraint and prevision. and it cease and god grant them all thing for which they have strive and the heart of a beast in the place of a man s heart be give.

across a world where all men grieve and grieve strive the more the great day range like tide and leave our dead on every shore. heavy the load we undergo and our own hand prepare if we have parley with the foe the load our son must bear. 
before we loose the word that bid new world to birth need must we loosen first the sword of justice upon earth. or else all else be vain since life on earth begin and the spend world sink back again hopeless of god and man. 
a people and their king through ancient sin grow strong because they fear no reckon would set no bind to wrong. but now their hour be past and we who bore it find evil incarnate hold at last to answer to mankind. 
for agony and spoil of nation beat to dust for poison air and torture soil and cold command lust and every secret woe the shudder water saw will and fulfil by high and low let them relearn the law. 
that when the doom be read not high nor low shall say. my haughty or my humble head ha save me in this day. that till the end of time their remnant shall recall their father old confederate crime avail them not at all. 
that neither school nor priest nor king may build again a people with the heart of beast make wise concern men. whereby our dead shall sleep in honour unbetrayed and we in faith and honour keep that peace for which they pay.
