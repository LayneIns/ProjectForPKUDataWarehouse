blayne. on my soul i believe you re right. i m think of mr. cockley. the woman s an absolute wreck.

mackesy. with the rupee at one and sixpence. the little doones would be little debra doones with a fine mussoorie chi chi anent to bring home for the holiday. 
curtis. and a pair of be ewtiful sambhur horn for do to wear free of expense present by do. yes it s an enchant prospect. by the way the rupee hasn t do fall yet. the time will come when we shall think ourselves lucky if we only lose half our pay.

anthony. mr. herriott. 
blayne. after a long pause to the room generally. it s my notion that we be a set of fool. 
mackesy. nonsense. that business be knock on the head last season. why young mallard. 
anthony. mallard be a candlestick parade a such. think awhile. recollect last season and the talk then. mallard or no mallard do gandy ever talk to any other woman. 
curtis. there s something in that. it be slightly noticeable now you come to mention it. but she s at naini tat and he s at simla.

do. curious thing how some woman carry a fate with them. there be a mr. deegie in the central province whose men invariably fell away and get marry. it become a regular proverb with u when i be down there. i remember three men desperately devote to her and they all one after another take wife. 
curtis. that s odd. now i should have think that mr. deegie s influence would have lead them to take other men s wife. it ought to have make them afraid of the judgment of providence.

capt. g. to make it light. see here little love i ve one notion and jack ha another but we be both agree that all this equipment be about thirty pound too heavy. the thing be how to cut it down without weaken any part of it and at the same time allow the trooper to carry everything he want for his own comfort sock and shirt and thing of that kind. 
mr. g. why doesn t he pack them in a little trunk. 
capt. g. kiss her. oh you darling. pack them in a little trunk indeed. hussar don t carry trunk and it s a most important thing to make the horse do all the carry. 
mr. g. but why need you bother about it. you re not a trooper. 
capt. g. no. but i command a few score of him. and equipment be nearly everything in these day. 
mr. g. more than me. 
capt. g. stupid. of course not. but it s a matter that i m tremendously interest in because if i or jack or i and jack work out some sort of light saddlery and all that it s possible that we may get it adopt. 
mr. g. how. 
capt. g. sanction at home where they will make a seal pattern a pattern that all the saddler must copy and so it will be use by all the regiment.

mr. g. and be i only make to be amuse. 
capt. g. no of course. i merely mean that it couldn t interest you. 
mr. g. it s your work and and if you d let me i d count all these thing up. if they be too heavy you know by how much they be too heavy and you must have a list of thing make out to your scale of lightness and. 
capt. g. i have get both scale somewhere in my head. but it s hard to tell how light you can make a head stall for instance until you ve actually have a model make. 
mr. g. but if you read out the list i could copy it down and pin it up there just above your table. wouldn t that do. 
capt. g. it would be awf ly nice dear but it would be give you trouble for nothing. i can t work that way. i go by rule of thumb. i know the present scale of weight and the other one the one that i m try to work to will shift and vary so much that i couldn t be certain even if i write it down.

capt. m. hotly. i understand this one hundred and thirty seven new horse to be lick into shape somehow before luck come round again. a hairy heel draft who ll give more trouble than the horse. a camp next cold weather for a certainty. ourselves the first on the roster. the russian shindy ready to come to a head at five minute notice and you the best of u all back out of it all. think a little gaddy. you win t do it. 
capt. g. hang it a man ha some duty toward his family i suppose. 
capt. m. i remember a man though who tell me the night after amdheran when we be picket under jagai and he d leave his sword by the way do you ever pay ranken for that sword. in an utmanzai s head that man tell me that he d stick by me and the pink a long a he live. i don t blame him for not stick by me i m not much of a man but i do blame him for not stick by the pink hussar. 
capt. g. uneasily. we be little more than boy then. can t you see jack how thing stand. tisn t a if we be serve for our bread. we ve all of u more or le get the filthy lucre. i m lucky than some perhaps. there s no call for me to serve on. 
capt. m. none in the world for you or for u except the regimental. if you don t choose to answer to that of course. 
capt. g. don t be too hard on a man. you know that a lot of u only take up the thing for a few year and then go back to town and catch on with the rest. 
capt. m. not lot and they aren t some of u. 
capt. g. and then there be one s affair at home to be consider my place and the rent and all that. i don t suppose my father can last much long and that mean the title and so on. 
capt. m. fraid you win t be enter in the stud book correctly unless you go home. take six month then and come out in october. if i could slay off a brother or two i s pose i should be a marquis of sort. any fool can be that. but it need men gaddy men like you to lead flank squadron properly. don t you delude yourself into the belief that you re go home to take your place and prance about among pink nose kabuli dowager. you aren t build that way. i know good. 
capt. g. a man ha a right to live his life a happily a he can. you aren t marry. 
capt. m. no praise be to providence and the one or two woman who have have the good sense to jawab me. 
capt. g. then you don t know what it be to go into your own room and see your wife s head on the pillow and when everything else be safe and the house shut up for the night to wonder whether the roof beam win t give and kill her. 
capt. m. aside. revelation first and second. aloud. so o. i know a man who get squiffy at our mess once and confide to me that he never help his wife on to her horse without pray that she d break her neck before she come back. all husband aren t alike you see. 
capt. g. what on earth ha that to do with my case. the man must ha be mad or his wife a bad a they make em. 
capt. m. aside. no fault of yours if either weren t all you say. you ve forget the time when you be insane about the herriott woman. you always be a good hand at forget. aloud. not more mad than men who go to the other extreme. be reasonable gaddy. your roof beam be sound enough. 
capt. g. that be only a way of speak. i ve be uneasy and worry about the wife ever since that awful business three year ago when i nearly lose her. can you wonder. 
capt. m. oh a shell never fall twice in the same place. you ve pay your toll to misfortune why should your wife be pick out more than anybody else s. 
capt. g. i can talk just a reasonably a you can but you don t understand you don t understand. and then there s the butcha. deuce know where the ayah take him to sit in the even. he ha a bite of a cough. haven t you notice it. 
capt. m. bosh. the brigadier s jump out of his skin with pure condition. he s get a muzzle like a rise leaf and the chest of a two year old. what s demoralize you. 
capt. g. funk. that s the long and the short of it. funk. 
capt. m. but what be there to funk. 
capt. g. everything. it s ghastly. 
capt. m. ah. i see. 
you don t want to fight and by jingo when we do you ve get the kid you ve get the wife you ve get the money too. 
that s about the case eh. 
capt. g. i suppose that s it. but it s not br myself. it s because of them. at least i think it be. 
capt. m. be you sure. look at the matter in a cold blood light the wife be provide for even if you be wipe out tonight. she ha an ancestral home to go to money and the brigadier to carry on the illustrious name. 
capt. g. then it be for myself or because they be part of me. you don t see it. my life s so good so pleasant a it be that i want to make it quite safe. can t you understand. 
capt. m. perfectly. shelter pit for the off cer s charger a they say in the line. 
capt. g. and i have everything to my hand to make it so. i m sick of the strain and the worry for their sake out here. and there isn t a single real difficulty to prevent my drop it altogether. it ll only cost me jack i hope you ll never know the shame that i ve be go through for the past six month. 
capt. m. hold on there. i don t wish to be tell. every man ha his mood and tense sometimes. 
capt. g. laugh bitterly. ha he. what do you call crane over to see where your near fore land. 
capt. m. in my case it mean that i have be on the considerable bend and have come to parade with a head and a hand. it pass in three stride. 
capt. g. lower voice. it never pass with me jack. i m always think about it. phil gadsby funk a fall on parade. sweet picture isn t it. draw it for me. 
capt. m. gravely. heaven forbid. a man like you can t be a bad a that. a fall be no nice thing but one never give it a think. 
capt. g. doesn t one. wait till you ve get a wife and a youngster of your own and then you ll know how the roar of the squadron behind you turn you cold all up the back. 
capt. m. aside. and this man lead at amdheran after bagal deasin go under and we be all mix up together and he come out of the snow drip like a butch. aloud. skittle. the men can always open out and you can always pick your way more or le. we haven t the dust to bother u a the men have and whoever hear of a horse step on a man. 
capt. g. never a long a he can see. but do they open out for poor errington. 
capt. m. oh this be childish. 
capt. g. i know it be bad than that. i don t care. you ve ride van loo. be he the sort of brute to pick his way specially when we re come up in column of troop with any pace on. 
capt. m. once in a blue moon do we gallop in column of troop and then only to save time. aren t three length enough for you. 
capt. g. yes quite enough. they just allow for the full development of the smash. i m talk like a cur i know. but i tell you that for the past three month i ve felt every hoof of the squadron in the small of my back every time that i ve lead. 
capt. m. but gaddy this be awful. 
capt. g. isn t it lovely. isn t it royal. a captain of the pink hussar water up his charger before parade like the blast booze colonel of a black regiment. 
capt. m. you never do. 
capt. g. once only. he squelch like a mussuck and the troop sergeant major cock his eye at me. you know old haffy s eye. i be afraid to do it again. 
capt. m. i should think so. that be the best way to rupture old van loo s tummy and make him crumple you up. you know that. 
capt. g. i didn t care. it take the edge off him. 
capt. m. take the edge off him. gaddy you you you mustn t you know. think of the men. 
capt. g. that s another thing i be afraid of. d you s pose they know. 
capt. m. let s hope not. but they re deadly quick to spot skirm little thing of that kind. see here old man send the wife home for the hot weather and come to kashmir with me. we ll start a boat on the dal or cross the rhotang shoot ibex or loaf which you please. only come. you re a bite off your oat and you re talk nonsense. look at the colonel swag belly rascal that he be. he ha a wife and no end of a bow window of his own. can any one of u ride round him chalkstone and all. i can t and i think i can shove a crock along a bite. 
capt. g. some men be different. i haven t any nerve. lord help me i haven t the nerve. i ve take up a hole and a half to get my knee well under the wallet. i can t help it. i m so afraid of anything happen to me. on my soul i ought to be break in front of the squadron for cowardice. 
capt. m. ugly word that. i should never have the courage to own up. 
capt. g. i mean to lie about my reason when i begin but i ve get out of the habit of lie to you old man. jack you win t. but i know you win t. 
capt. m. of course not. half aloud. the pink be pay dearly for their pride. 
capt. g. eb. what at. 
capt. m. don t you know. the men have call mr. gadsby the pride of the pink hussar ever since she come to u. 
capt. g. tisn t her fault. don t think that. it s all mine. 
capt. m. what doe she say. 
capt. g. i haven t exactly put it before her. she s the best little woman in the world jack and all that but she wouldn t counsel a man to stick to his call if it come between him and her. at least i think. 
capt. m. never mind. don t tell her what you tell me. go on the peerage and land gentry tack. 
capt. g. she d see through it. she s five time clever than i be. 
capt. m. aside. then she ll accept the sacrifice and think a little bite bad of him for the rest of her day. 
capt. g. absently. i say do you despise me. 
capt. m. queer way of put it. have you ever be ask that question. think a minute. what answer use you to give. 
capt. g. so bad a that. i m not entitle to expect anything more but it s a bite hard when one s best friend turn round and. 
capt. m. so. have find but you will have consolation bailiff and drain and liquid manure and the primrose league and perhaps if you re lucky the colonelcy of a yeomanry cav al ry regiment all uniform and no rid i believe. how old be you. 
capt. g. thirty three. i know it s. 
capt. m. at forty you ll be a fool of a j. p. landlord. at fifty you ll own a bath chair and the brigadier if he take after you will be flutter the dovecote of what s the particular dunghill you re go to. also mr. gadsby will be fat. 
capt. g. limply. this be rather more than a joke. 
capt. m. d you think so. isn t cut the service a joke. it generally take a man fifty year to arrive at it. you re quite right though. it be more than a joke. you ve manage it in thirty three. 
capt. g. don t make me feel bad than i do. will it satisfy you if i own that i be a shirker a skrim shanker and a coward. 
capt. m. it wil. not because i m the only man in the world who can talk to you like this without be knock down. you mustn t take all that i ve say to heart in this way. i only speak a lot of it at least out of pure selfishness because because oh damn it all old man i don t know what i shall do without you. of course you ve get the money and the place and all that and there be two very good reason why you should take care of yourself. 
capt. g. doesn t make it any sweet. i m back out i know i be. i always have a soft drop in me somewhere and i daren t risk any danger to them. 
capt. m. why in the world should you. you re bind to think of your family bind to think. er hmm. if i wasn t a young son i d go too be shoot if i wouldn t. 
capt. g. thank you jack. it s a kind lie but it s the black you ve tell for some time. i know what i m do and i m go into it with my eye open. old man i can t help it. what would you do if you be in my place. 
capt. m. aside. couldn t conceive any woman get permanently between me and the regiment. aloud. can t say. very likely i should do no good. i m sorry for you awf ly sorry but if them s your sentiment i believe i really do that you be act wisely. 
capt. g. do you. i hope you do. in a whisper. jack be very sure of yourself before you marry. i m an ungrateful ruffian to say this but marriage even a good a marriage a mine ha be hamper a man s work it cripple his sword arm and oh it play hell with his notion of duty. sometimes good and sweet a she be sometimes i could wish that i have keep my freedom no i don t mean that exactly. 
mr. g. come down veranda. what be you wag your head over pip. 
capt. m. turn quickly. me a usual. the old sermon. your husband be recommend me to get marry. never saw such a one ideaed man. 
mr. g. well why don t you. i dare say you would make some woman very happy. 
capt. g. there s the law and the prophet jack. never mind the regiment. make a woman happy. aside. o lord. 
capt. m. we ll see. i must be off to make a troop cook desperately unhappy. i win t have the wily hussar feed on government bullock train shinbone. hastily. surely black ant can t be good for the brigadier. he s pick em off the mat and eat em. here senor comandante don grubbynuse come and talk to me. lift g. junior in his arm. want my watch. you win t be able to put it into your mouth but you can try. g. junior drop watch break dial and hand. 
mr. g. oh captain mafflin i be so sorry. jack you bad bad little villain. ahhh. 
capt. m. it s not the least consequence i assure you. he d treat the world in the same way if he could get it into his hand. everything s make to be play with and break isn t it young un. 
* * * * *. 
mr. g. mafflin didn t at all like his watch be break though he be too polite to say so. it be entirely his fault for give it to the child. dem little pud be werry werry feeble aren t dey by jack in de box. to g. what do he want to see you for. 
capt. g. regimental shop a usual. 
mr. g. the regiment. always the regiment. on my word i sometimes feel jealous of mafflin. 
capt. g. wearily. poor old jack. i don t think you need. isn t it time for the butcha to have his nap. bring a chair out here dear. i ve get some thing to talk over with you. 
and this be the end of the story of the gadsbys.
